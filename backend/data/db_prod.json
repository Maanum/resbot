      "articleText": "Data permeates every facet of ship and fleet management. From routes and fuel consumption to equipment, spare parts, work orders, and certificates, data forms the foundation of critical decision-making processes. Compliance reports, financial analysis, and operational planning rely on accurate and reliable data. Regardless of the software used, the quality of the underlying data takes precedence.\nSoftware is being unfairly blamed for problems stemming from flawed data. Even seemingly minor discrepancies in data representation, such as abbreviations or language variations, can lead to significant errors. A computer system might interpret M.E. and M.H. as distinct components, causing confusion in spare part orders and maintenance procedures. Insurance issues, operational disruptions, and safety concerns can arise from incorrect data. It is clear that data quality is paramount. Creating a comprehensive and accurate database has historically been a resource-intensive task. Investments of time and funds were required to ensure data was properly structured. However, despite technological advancements, many shipping companies continue to neglect data management. Manual data entry from technical manuals and disparate formats persists, hindering the efficiency of operations and maintenance.\nThe aviation and defence industry provides a shining example of how data-driven practices can revolutionize an industry. By emphasizing precise information, standardizing technical manuals, work procedures, and information systems, they achieved comprehensive digitalization. We can draw inspiration from their approach and apply it to the shipping industry.\nUndeniably, digitization alone is an incomplete catalyst for true digital transformation. The conversion of documents into PDFs or furnishing Excel spreadsheets for data entry scarcely scratches the surface. To realize the formidable potential of digitalization, precise and standardized data collection is pivotal. This mandate extends to the development of digital interfaces and the eradication of manual data input errors. The core of digitalization is accurate data and standardized practices.\nRasmus Gade Hansen, Head of Projects at SERTICA by RINA, confirms: “As a software company, we are met by many customers who have an ambition to use software to improve their business. We aim to supply software that covers the needs and requirements of the customer, and helps them improve. More and more customers realize that to get the most benefit from software solutions, they have to have high quality data. The combination of a good software product, and good data, highly increases the benefits that the customers gain from their solutions. Often companies tend to focus on the software, and might forget the importance of having quality data. We see a standardized way of exchanging data, as a key driver for the distribution of quality data. If all suppliers/manufacturers make up their own formats, it will always require a lot of work for customers to integrate the data into their solutions”.\nRasmus Gade Hansen continues: “Shipdex offers this kind of standardization, and that is why we support it, and have enabled exchange of it directly into SERTICA. When building the Shipdex integration in our platform, we tried to make it as easy as possible for customers to import their datasets. This speeds up the implementation process of the platform, as there is no cumbersome manual work in manually trying to setup the equipment data. The Shipdex standard offers clear definitions and descriptions, and implementing the interface into SERTICA went according to plan. Today, a customer can receive a Shipdex dataset, and import it directly into Sertica, with no involvement from us. We see that as effective.”\nMarco Vatteroni, SHIPDEX co-founder and technical manager, emphasizes “I developed the Shipdex Protocol during my tenure as the Shipdex technical manager and I was responsible for creating, maintaining, and enhancing the Protocol. During the same period, I worked for a very important CMMS provider and I designed a robust and powerful software application capable of identifying and comprehending data formatted in Shipdex. This application was also able to import selected data into a CMMS database. The application (interface) was effectively utilized to create CMMS databases for some specific ship-owners.”\nShipdex ensures that the data collected is uniform and follows standardized practices. This uniformity enhances interoperability between different software systems and applications, facilitating seamless data exchange and integration. By eliminating the need for data reconciliation or data conversion efforts, software developers can focus on creating value-added solutions and leveraging data-driven insights to enhance efficiency and performance.\nShipdex’s non-proprietary nature and its protocols make it a reliable resource for software developers. It transcends individual company affiliations and focuses on providing the maritime industry with a common framework for collecting and utilizing high-quality, standardized data.\nWith the increasing connectivity and a drive for operational efficiency, reliability, and compliance, the maritime industry is investing heavily in maintenance and IT systems. However, software alone is not enough to achieve the desired outcomes. Software developers, like any other responsible maritime stakeholder, must advocate for the value of correct data and embrace Shipdex as the maritime protocol, in their own interest and the interest of the maritime sector.\nTo achieve true digitalization in the shipping industry, data standardization is paramount. Standardized and structured data will enable remote monitoring, machine learning, software control, and business intelligence. Software developers must advocate for and contribute to data standardization efforts.\nSoftware developers have a pivotal role in the digital transformation of the shipping industry. They can greatly benefit from adopting Shipdex, as its primary advantage lies in its ability to streamline the collection of data directly from manufacturers. This direct import mechanism replaces time-consuming and error-prone manual processes that often result in incomplete, non-uniform, or incorrect information. By bypassing these challenges, software developers can work with a robust and comprehensive dataset, enabling accurate planning, precise maintenance schedules, and efficient resource management.\nSource: SHIPDEX",

      "articleText": "in International Shipping News,Shipping: Emission Possible\n22/08/2023\n\nCargill and BAR Technologies’ groundbreaking WindWings innovation sets sail on open waters, testing new technology that will bring cutting edge wind propulsion to commercial shipping for the first time.\nMitsubishi Corporation’s Pyxis Ocean, chartered by Cargill, is the first vessel to be retrofitted with two WindWings, which are large wing sails measuring up to 45 meters in height that can be fitted to the deck of bulk cargo ships to harness the power of wind. Manufactured by industrialization partner Yara Marine Technologies, they are expected to generate average fuel savings of up to 30 percent on new build vessels, which could be even higher if used in combination with alternative fuels. The installation of the wings took place at the COSCO shipyard in China and the Pyxis Ocean is now on the water, conducting her maiden voyage.\n“The maritime industry is on a journey to decarbonize—it’s not an easy one, but it is an exciting one,” said Jan Dieleman, President of Cargill’s Ocean transportation business. “At Cargill we have a responsibility to pioneer decarbonizing solutions across all our supply chains to meet our customer’s needs and the needs of the planet. A technology like WindWings doesn’t come without risk, and as an industry leader – in partnership with visionary shipowner MC Shipping – we are not afraid to invest, take those risks and be transparent with our learnings to help our partners in maritime transition to a more sustainable future.”\nThe installation demonstrates a step-change in attitudes towards technologies that can enable an energy transition for existing vessels. The maritime industry faces a huge challenge to reduce average CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030 and is working towards 50% by 2050. The WindWings project, which is co-funded by the European Union as part of the CHEK Horizon 2020 initiative, can help the industry meet those targets by offering a retrofit solution that is capable of decarbonizing existing vessels, which is particularly relevant given that 55 percent of the world’s bulker fleet are up to nine years in age.\nThe performance of the sails will be closely monitored over the coming months to further improve their design, operation, and performance, with the aim that the Pyxis Ocean will be used to inform the scale-up and adoption across not only Cargill’s fleet but the industry. BAR Technologies is already planning to build hundreds of wings over the next four years and is also researching new builds with differing hydrodynamic forms.\n“If international shipping is to achieve its ambition of reducing CO2 emissions, then innovation must come to the fore. Wind is a near marginal cost-free fuel and the opportunity for reducing emissions, alongside significant efficiency gains in vessel operating costs, is substantial. Today is the culmination of years of pioneering research, where we’ve invested in our unique wind sail technology and sought out a skilled manufacturing partner in Yara Marine Technologies, in order to provide vessel owners and operators with an opportunity to realize these efficiencies,” said John Cooper, Chief Executive Officer, BAR Technologies.\nSource: BAR Technologies",

      "articleText": "in International Shipping News,Shipping: Emission Possible\n21/08/2023\n\nMaritime’s regulatory environment is becoming more complex by the day, especially where sustainability is concerned. With the United Nations Global Compact and IMO’s decarbonization drawing ever closer, the onus on shipping companies to reduce emissions looms large, and it’s only made more daunting by the global fleet’s current performance.\nIn 2021, international shipping emitted nearly 700 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (MtCO₂) into the atmosphere, an uptick of roughly five percent from 2020. And, in 2022, it seems the trend continued with current estimates revealing that the industry likely added to its emissions total rather than lowering it. If this pattern continues, the industry will end the decade much further from meeting the regulatory guidance — but there may be a way to rewrite the story.\nLeaders and experts in maritime technology, ship design, and climate science have given plenty of attention to the industry’s slow start, citing obstacles such as legacy fleets, a lack of clean fuel options, and other equipment-related concerns. While it’s true that advancements in these areas will be critical to getting back on track, they aren’t the only innovations that will help bring decarbonized shipping within reach.\nDiscussions of this challenge consistently overlook a primary issue underlying maritime’s struggle to meet the required guidance: the rate at which emissions reports are shared and analyzed. While shippers have been engaging in emissions logging and reporting for some time now (the first regulations related to the issue were introduced in 1997), the process has, since its inception, been a manual one.\nThat complicates things for shippers trying to understand their impact. To start, it hides problem areas from operators, making it more difficult to adapt and adjust alongside operational pressures. Furthermore, it hides information about what’s working and what’s not, making it difficult for the wider community to follow the lead of companies modeling responsible practices.\nGurinder Singh, Director of Technical Sales at ABS Wavesight\nYou can’t change what you can’t see\nManual reporting is labor-intensive and time-consuming—and that doesn’t even account for the time it takes to integrate and analyze these reports. When historical data isn’t made available until months (or years) later, owners and operators don’t have accurate and current baselines from which to work. Without that context, making informed, impactful decisions is essentially impossible; it’s guesswork.\nManual models can highlight errors and successes from months prior, but they cannot give insight into a fleet’s current condition and potential maintenance requirements. Case in point, at the time of writing (August 2023) in-depth analyses from 2022 are only now becoming available. In writing this piece, I cannot even reference the most recent numbers with confidence in their veracity or totality.\nIt’s this lack of current insight and the hesitancy to share performance data that has long prevented shippers from moving the needle toward more efficient operations—and it’s this obstacle that maritime’s newfound digital communication and monitoring capabilities can help operators overcome.\nConnectivity comes to sea\nUnlike new ships or advanced fuels, connectivity is here, and it’s likely to be the foundation on which maritime’s sustainable future is built. Though digitalization within maritime lagged for some time, advancements in internet of things (IoT) equipment and the increasing accessibility of low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites and low-latency networks have brought automated reporting within operators’ reach.\nBy having precise information about carbon emissions, fuel waste, and other factors that contribute to sustainability performance, digitalization can help operators future-proof their fleets.\nWhen paired with analytics software that delivers real-time performance monitoring and reporting, owners can proactively address operational requirements such as voyage planning, vessel maintenance, and port compliance. To address commercial and technical concerns, operators can leverage similar data sets to help inform broader organizational changes, which can contribute to wider margins and more resources to devote to sustainability investments down the line.\nOn your marks, get set…\nAs with all data-based endeavors, the value of a dataset correlates directly to its breadth and depth. Beginning the process of connected integration now will ensure that, when the time comes, operators have the real-time and historical context that drives change, the security measures necessary to protect their operations, and the insight they need to make decisions that safeguard their businesses and the industry’s future.\nThe transition will not happen overnight, but it will happen—it is happening. Engaging in a maritime digital transformation journey – or any major industry transformational period—is an ongoing process that requires a commitment to transparency and continuous improvement from everyone in the maritime ecosystem—from owners, operators, and industry regulators to ports, suppliers, and everything in between. Those that start early will find themselves ahead of the pack as connected fleets become the norm, both in terms of their systems’ value to the company and their progress toward regulatory goals.\nSource: By Gurinder Singh, Director of Technical Sales at ABS Wavesight\n\nTagged with: Tops",

However, for all its benefits, implementing the method requires careful consideration, says Andreas Symeonidis, Marketing and Partner Relations Manager, METIS Cyberspace Technology.\nFrom January this year, by the time of their first periodical survey, ships of 400gt and above must satisfy IMO’sEnergy Efficiency eXisting ship Index (EEXI) – a measure of their technical ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nEPL and ShaPoLi\nTo improve efficiency and achieve compliance with EEXI requirements, engine power limitation (EPL) and shaft power limitation (ShaPoLi) are proving the most popular among shipowners thanks to their relative simplicity, cost efficiency and minimal impact on vessel operations.\nBoth are approved, non-permanent and tamper-proof methods of power limitation, with EPL limiting maximum engine power directly and ShaPoLi achieving the same result by restricting maximum shaft power.\nMore specifically, the systems limit the engine’s maximum output, or maximum continuous rating (MCR), to a percentage of its original output depending on the vessel’s individual EEXI requirements. The new maximum engine power, the EEXI calculation point, is 75% of its limited MCR (MCRlim). Once this has been established, the ship can operate up to its MCRlim. Since engine power is proportional to the cube of vessel speed, a 10% decrease in speed reduces hourly fuel consumption by almost 30%.\n\nOther solutions for meeting EEXI requirements include clean technologies – such as batteries, waste-heat recovery systems, air lubrication and wind-assisted propulsion – and low- or zero-carbon fuels. However, on their own, these solutions may not have a sufficient impact on energy efficiency to achieve the required EEXI rating, meaning engine power limitation will be needed anyway in most cases.\nFor all the benefits of EPL or ShaPoLi, there are several factors that shipowners must consider before implementing a power limitation device.\nOverriding the MCRlim\nAt the 76th session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee in June 2021, the IMO adopted a resolution providing guidance on EEXI compliance and the use of a power reserve with an EPL or ShaPoLi system. According to the resolution, power limitation is only to be overridden in the interests of safety, for example in harsh weather conditions where accessing the power reserve may help to save lives at sea. Furthermore, the use of the power reserve must issue an alert and be recorded in the ship’s onboard management manual.\n\nReviewing time charter parties\nThe ability to gather, measure and analyze equipment performance represents a key requirement in effective EPL and ShaPoLi implementation, and nowhere is this more apparent than in considering potential issues arising between shipowners and charterers. Since power limitation can affect a vessel’s speed, performance and description, the adoption of an EPL or ShaPoLi system necessitates a thorough review – and possibly a re-negotiation – of existing time charter party agreements. It was to address this issue that BIMCO developed its EEXI Transition Clause for Time Charter Parties 2021.\nConsidering the wider implications\nIn fact, the impact of power limitation on vessel speed can create issues throughout the supply chain, causing delays in the delivery of goods and other logistical complications. It may even cause heightened demand for vessels to compensate for increased delivery times, which could counteract the environmental benefits of power limitation. Moreover, with many shipowners already mitigating fuel consumption and emissions through slow steaming, a significant proportion of the global merchant fleet would likely yield no additional benefit from implementing an EPL or ShaPoLi system.Therefore, although power limitation represents a practical means of meeting EEXI requirements, shipowners need to carefully consider the operational implications of adopting EPL or ShaPoLi, while the industry must work to address concerns surrounding the method’s widespread implementation. Using AI-based analytics to verify their effectiveness provides a good place to start.\nSource: METIS",

      "articleText": "There has been increasing interest in expanding existing domestic emission trading schemes to also cover international shipping. There is now agreement in the EU on how the EU’s emission trading system will be applied to shipping from 2024. Owners and charterers should start to think about how they are going to deal with its requirements.\nOn a nation state level, governments can impose taxes on the sources of pollution at the point of production or sale. An example is petrol, with the aim that the taxes generated will cover the cost of dealing with the resulting pollution and incentivise reduced consumption. The difficulty in international shipping is that if just a few governments took this approach for bunker fuel, the buyers would likely adjust their arrangements so that they avoided bunkering at the taxed ports. Therefore, for a sales tax on bunker fuel to be effective, governments of all the major bunkering ports around the world would need to coordinate and agree to tax bunker fuel in the same way. With such cooperation looking very unlikely in the near term, and IMO discussion of a carbon tax still in its early stages, governments are now looking at imposing costs on emissions, rather than on fuel at the point of sale.\nAn emission trading scheme (ETS) is a tool that governments and regulators are expected to use increasingly often in the fight to reduce the pollution created by international shipping. The central idea behind an ETS is to have a market mechanism to ensure that “the polluter pays” – the payment being for the environmental and social cost of pollution, its clean-up cost and potentially also research into technology that will reduce or remove it. Of course, increasing the cost of pollution also creates an incentive to generate less of it.\nFor this reason, there has been growing interest in expanding existing emission trading schemes to include international shipping, including in the EU, China and Japan. The basic idea of an ETS is that a capped number of emission permits are bought and sold on the market, with emitters having to purchase and surrender enough allowances to cover their emissions. The price of the allowances will change over time to reflect the balance of supply and demand, and emitters then are incentivised to find the cheapest (ie. most efficient) ways to reduce emissions.\nThe EU Emission Trading Scheme\nLaunched in 2005, the EU’s Emission Trading System works as a “cap and trade” scheme where emitters of CO2 in certain sectors have to purchase allowances to cover their carbon emissions during the relevant trading period. The number of allowances at any one time are fixed, but they generally reduce each year, so that emissions within the EU also fall.\nHow the scheme will be applied to shipping has beenunder discussion for some time, but there now seems to be agreement between the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission thatthe key features will be:\n• Application to all vessels over 5,000 GT trading within EU waters, irrespective of flag\n• Start date of 1 January 2024 (pushed back from 1 January 2023)\n• A phased-in implementation, with 40% of emissions covered by the system during 2024, 70% for 2025 and 100% for 2026.\n• All intra-EU voyage emissions to be covered by the scheme\n• 50% of EU in-bound/out-bound voyage emissions will be covered\n• The ‘shipping company’ (defined as owner, manager or bareboat charterer) will be responsible for surrendering the allowances\n• The system will cover carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide\n• 30 April deadline for surrender of allowances for the previous calendar year -for example, 30 April 2025 deadline for 2024 emissions\n• Non-compliance can lead to penalties and expulsion orders\nSeveral parts of the scheme are still unclear, and questions have been raised about two particular areas relating to shipping. First, in the Special Rapporteur’s report of 24 January 2022, it says that where a ship is on charter and the owner is not responsible for purchasing fuel or making decisions about the vessel’s speed, cargo or route, then:\n“… a binding clause should be included in such arrangements for the purpose of passing on the costs so that the entity that is ultimately responsible for the decisions affecting the CO2 emissions of the ship is held accountable for covering the compliance costs paid by the shipping company under this Directive.”\nWhilst many vessel owners would support the motivation behind this provision, it is far from clear how EU law would impose such a clause in private contractual arrangements between parties that may not be based in EU states. What happens if the charterparty contains no such clause? Could the owners rely on EU law to seek recovery from the charterers in the EU even if there was no such clause in the charterparty? Might it result in some voyage-charterers being forced to pay for EU ETS allowances even though they did not supply the fuel?\nA second area of discussion is how emissions on voyages into or out of the EU are to be determined, and if operators may seek to evade the full application of the EU ETS. For example, if a vessel calls at an intermediate port just outside of the EU shortly after leaving EU waters, that may result in the out-bound voyage being assessed as much shorter than one from/to the actual next load port. The change of routing may cause the operator extra costs, but the benefit of the avoided allowances could be greater, depending on the assumptions made. We would expect this issue to be covered by the scheme once implemented, but at the moment it is an area that needs more thought.\nEmission trading schemes and time charterparties\nOperating vessels under an ETS is a completely new situation for vessel owners and time charterers, so the learning curve will be steep. The issues under each scheme may be different, but the following points are likely to be of general relevance, not just to the EU system.\nIn the first instance, the practical steps needed to comply with ETS requirements are likely to fall on vessel owners. This will include (i) registration with the scheme, (ii) recording, documenting and submitting the vessel’s emissions data needed for compliance, and (iii) opening an account to receive, hold and surrender the necessary allowances. It may be that some of these tasks can be handled by a third party, such as a vessel manager or broker.\nHow a vessel owner and charterer share the costs of complying with an ETS is more open to negotiation. The general view seems to be that as ETS costs will be directly linked to the fuel used by the vessel, as between an owner and a charterer, whoever is responsible for the cost of the fuel should also cover the cost of ETS compliance by buying allowances. This seems logical as the cost of ETS allowances could be seen as just part of the fuel cost and may in fact be included in bunker prices if bunker sellers decide to sell fuel and allowances together.\nNew BIMCO clause\nBIMCO has an ETS– Emission Trading Scheme Allowances Clause for TimeCharter Parties 2022. Under the clause, the charterer is responsible for purchasing and transferring to the ownersallowances to cover the vessel’s actual emissions used in ETS areas while on hire. The clause also covers other issues, such as sharing data to enable compliance with an ETS, reconciliation between the allowances and actual consumption at the end of a charter, and giving the owners a right to suspend\nThe BIMCO clause has been draftedto apply to any scheme around the world, and to cover any greenhouse gas that may be subject to a scheme, not just carbon.\nUnder most time charterparties, the vessel owner does what they can to reduce their credit risk to the charterer – for example by requiring hire to paid in advance, and bunkers arranged and paid for by the charterer. One issue that some vessel owners may also wish to consider is if they want similar principles to apply for ETS allowances. To avoid allowances being transferred in arrears, owners could require the charterer to transfer enough allowances up front to cover the bunker fuel to be used under the ETS, to be topped up as/when the vessel receives new fuel. If so, the BIMCO clause would need to be amended. From a time charterer’s point of view, it may also be necessary to consider how the reconciliation and accounting will be carried out for emissions, which are arguably for owners’ account, such as during off-hire or deviation for owners’ purposes.\nThese issues are unlikely to be relevant in the context of voyage charters, where the owner will generally be responsible for supplying the fuel, and hence the cost of any allowances that arise from using it. Owners who voyage charter will therefore need to build something into their freight/demurrage rates for ETS costs. The costs of ETS allowances may be relevant under some consecutive voyage charterers if they have clauses to adjust freight rates depending on bunker prices – for example, if bunkers are sold inclusive of allowance costs, or as ETS allowance prices change.\nWhat to do now?\nNow that the EU’s emission trading system has been agreed, vessel owners and charterers that may trade within the EU should ensure they are prepared for comply with its requirements in 2024. Preparation includes setting up contractual arrangements to suit their needs, for which the BIMCO ETS clause is a good starting point.

      "articleText": "AI and big data processing can help address one of shipping’s main problems today, i.e. emissions reduction through voyage optimization. In an exclusive interview with Dr Konstantinos Kyriakopoulos, CEO and Co-Founder of DeepSea Technologies, Hellenic Shipping News Worldwide (www.hellenicshippingnews.com), discusses the technology advancements which can help reduce emission today.\nVoyage optimization is widely regarded as a key tool towards reducing emissions and lowering costs. What are the main benefits?\nThe basic principle of voyage optimisation is that almost every voyage sailed today contains a degree of waste. Perhaps not a very large degree – up to 10% depending on the voyage – but that is still enough to transform a company’s bottom line and significantly boost a vessel’s CII rating. Why is this ‘margin of waste’ such a consistent feature of the industry? It’s because squeezing the last 10% efficiency out of a voyage is about precisely tailoring how it’s operated to the current set of conditions. To do that requires an incredibly accurate knowledge of how every individual vessel responds to every conceivable set of conditions, which nobody has by default.\nDr Konstantinos Kyriakopoulos, CEO and Co-Founder of DeepSea Technologies\nHow does the technology that DeepSea offers to the market work?\nDeepSea solves this problem. We take data from individual vessels and use artificial intelligence to generate a +98%-accurate behaviour model. It accounts for all the factors you’d expect – wind, waves, draft, fouling – and can predict how much fuel the ship will consume at different potential speeds within encountered conditions. The model is completely unique and updated live, in real time, as things change. What it gives us is, for the first time ever, true predictability over vessel behaviour. In other words, a real data-driven foundation for the decisions we make.\nThe practical outcome is a custom-built speed (and, optionally, route) plan for every vessel and every voyage, which we communicate and monitor via our platform, Pythia.\nWhat’s the expected cost per vessel? Does it vary by ship type/size?\nWe’re currently seeing a return-on-investment of around 15x. We know there’s a lot more potential there – our clients see better and better results as this approach gets embedded in their organisation. All deep-sea ships can benefit from this approach – the ROI is higher for larger vessels, but we’re seeing a massive net-benefit from this approach across the board.\nHow keen are owners to adopt these new technologies? Do you see more uptake from specific parts of the industry, compared to others?\nIt’s no surprise that different trading models lead to different incentives. Much of the industry suffers from the ‘split incentive’ problem that we all know well – the charterer pays for the fuel that the owner burns. So, the incentive to be more efficient lies squarely with the charterer, whilst the ability to implement it lies with the owner. And in a world where more efficient vessels still aren’t commanding bigger premiums in the market, it presents a substantial obstacle to the decarbonisation of the industry.\nThe companies that, therefore, really benefit from our solutions today are owner/operators – those with both the incentive to make changes, and the power to implement them. For this sector of the industry, these sorts of initiatives are a no-brainer.\nWhat are the main barriers towards a wider adoption of AI and generally voyage optimization technologies?\nAlong with the issue of misaligned incentives mentioned above, I believe that there is a particular tendency in the shipping industry to reach for ‘trusty’ metal rather than ‘mysterious’ silicon. Shipping has always had to be immensely technically resilient – issues at sea can be very dangerous, and vessels can’t rely on any form of external support. They must solve their own problems. This naturally leads to a culture of “trust what you see”, and “what’s complex is dangerous” – a mindset which extends even to well-proven and non-critical systems. In some people’s view, AI (and algorithmic voyage optimisation) is at the other end of the spectrum – a ‘black box’ which they don’t understand. There is some truth in this, of course, but the only way shipping can face up to its current challenges is to fully embrace digitisation. A degree of technical autonomy may be lost on a vessel-by-vessel basis, but what will be gained is immeasurably more powerful.\nDo you expect them to play a key role in the event of a future supply chain disruption?\nIt’s certain that our level of understanding of how vessels and ports really behave – and how they interact – is majorly lacking. In 2023, when our cars are beginning to drive themselves, most vessels are still reporting their key data to shore via a single email per day (full of manually entered figures that may bear scant resemblance to reality). By and large, the industry functions in a state of continuous ‘low-definition’, which can be seen in everything from the vagueness of charter parties to the way fuel levels are measured. Ultimately, we should have much more resilient and accurate models of how the shipping industry works – and AI is certainly one of the best tools humans have to crack that nut. The first step to this “high definition revolution” – which has immense financial and environmental benefits for shipping companies – is to start digitising our fleet at a much faster rate than we have until now.\nNikos Roussanoglou, Hellenic Shipping News Worldwide",

      "articleText": "in International Shipping News,Shipping: Emission Possible\n04/08/2023\n\nOver 1GWh of batteries are now sailing on waters globally, reflecting 72% industry growth in 2022. Despite this, there have been several challenges that shipbuilders and maritime battery suppliers have had to navigate in recent years.\nFirstly, electric ship markets have historically been underpinned by electric ferry orders, which made up 37% of the maritime battery capacity (GWh) deliveries between 2019 and 2022. Norway is a key driver behind this, with around 100 electric ferries in operation – the most in the world. However, IDTechEx expects market saturation here soon as government targets are set to be surpassed next year.\nElectric and hybrid vessels are also typically new-builds, specifically designed to be efficient with electric propulsion. However, the recent climate of uncertainty and inflation arising from the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war has had a negative impact on new-build contracts, including on ship-types targeted for electrification.\nThe IDTechEx report “Electric Boats & Ships 2024-2044” provides granular 20-year forecasts in unit sales, battery demand (GWh) & battery market value ($ bn) for electric ferry, electric cargo/container, electric Ro-Ro, electric cruise, electric OSV, electric tugboat and electric recreational boats by power class (<1kW, <12kW, >25kW). Based on primary supplier interviews, it further shares technology analysis and price information on marine Li-ion battery systems ($/kWh 2020 – 2044) and electric propulsion systems.\nThe future of the electric ship industry lies with hybrid cargo vessels. While this has not been a major historic market, new contracts for container ships have been steady. IDTechEx expects that zero-emission anchorage requirements, upcoming IMO and EU regulations, and the possibility for larger battery systems per vessel will drive battery installations.\nThe potential is huge. Less than a percent of the global merchant fleet currently runs on alternative fuels (including batteries), and battery systems improve the efficiency of both engines and future technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells. Systems sizes per vessel have also been increasing and can span into the tens of mega-watt hour per vessel – another driver for growth.\nAs the market develops, competition from China is also heating up. China-based battery suppliers are finding success in offering low prices for type-approved marine battery systems. This is achieved with high levels of vertical integration and battery chemistries such as LFP, which is predominantly manufactured in China. Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), one of the world’s largest battery suppliers, is a good example. The company set up a subsidiary to develop batteries for ships in 2022 and has already contracted or delivered at least 16MWh.\nIn the short term, marine battery suppliers outside China may command a premium due to very high levels of experience in this safety-critical sector. However, China’s entry will help consolidate and streamline the value chain as well as drive the next phase of growth for the industry as it sails into multi giga-watt hour territory.\nSource: IDTechEx Research",

(President: Yoshinobu Odagaki; Hikone-shi, Shiga Prefecture) has been selected for a Shiga Prefecture-backed project to promote social implementation of near-future technologies (Note 1).\nMOL is promoting the Wind Hunter Project (Note 2), which harnesses offshore wind energy to produce hydrogen from water onboard and convert it into propulsion for vessels, to realize a decarbonized, hydrogen-based society. However, hydrogen production requires a higher level of water purity, even more than drinking water. During the Wind Hunter hydrogen production process, seawater is first purified by passing it through a filter to remove impurities such as organic matter (carbon content, microplastics, etc.), inorganic matter (iron, magnesium, sodium), and sludge, but the filters currently in common use require frequent replacement, which increases the workload of crewmembers and imposes a significant cost burden.\nHow the purified water production system works\nIn this development, the three parties will play the following roles to develop long-lasting, durable, and high-performance filters that will be able to remove even bacteria, which will require even more advanced technology in the future, and to manufacture a pure water production system.\nMOL: Project management, market research, and provision of expertise in marine system design\nKyushu University: Designing demonstration test of pure water production system, development and application of high-performance filter (Note 3)\nTaiyo Sangyo: Development and application of a reverse osmosis (RO) system (Note 4)\nThe development of more efficient onboard technology to produce pure water from seawater in the Wind Hunter project will mark a major step toward the realization of large zero-emission ships.\n\nIn this project, a pure water production system will be designed not only for seawater but also for fresh water through a demonstration test in Lake Biwa in Shiga Prefecture. MOL will assess the effects of differences in water quality and establish a versatile pure water production technology by comparing seawater with fresh water from Lake Biwa, the largest lake in Japan. It will not only create pure water production technology for the Wind Hunter project, but also apply the developed technology to supply pure water to hydrogen production plant and other applications.\nMOL set a target of achieving net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the entire MOL Group by 2050 in the “MOL Group Environmental Vision 2.2,” It will contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions and the realization of a decarbonized society, not only by reducing its own GHG emissions, but also by actively participating in this project and others to build a clean energy supply chain.\nSource: Mitsui O.S.K.

If it has, indeed, made an offer for the Korean carrier.\nAnother factor that could also play into the rankings merry-go-round is the level of scrapping. That will normally depend on a complicated calculation by the lines of whether a vessel can earn sufficient income in its later years if it continues trading, compared to the savings made by scrapping and the income from that sale to breakers, that is the price of steel.\nThat calculation will be further complicated by the January introduction of the EU ETS, which is expected to herald the introduction of similar carbon pricing schemes in other jurisdictions.\nOlder ships are less efficient, but whether rates can support upgrading costs, perhaps to operate on alternative fuels remains to be seen.\n\nCopyright © 2023.

      "articleText": "A shipping enthusiast since he was a child, thanks to his grandfather working in the industry, Mr Langelaan has spent the past two years restoring the vessel with the aim of returning it to its original role – transporting cargo.\nLast month, the ship set sail on its first commercial voyage under the ownership of Mr Langelaan’s company, Ecoclipper.\nCarrying mixed loads that included everything from cheese, to wine and olive oil, the 40-metre (131ft) long craft travelled from Amsterdam in the Netherlands, to Porto in Portugal, and back again. With stops in Spain, France and England.\nDe Tukker can carry 70 tonnes of cargo and up to 12 passengers. In her previous life she transported building supplies and produce along the Dutch and German coasts.\nWind-powered cargo ships ruled the world’s waves back in the 19th Century. Then the adoption of the steam engine saw them replaced by much-larger, coal-powered alternatives.\nToday’s giant container ships mostly use heavy fuel oil, with the sector said to contribute 3% of global carbon emissions. Given increasing concerns about climate change, proponents of returning to wind-powered ships to transport cargo say that sometimes old tech is the best new tech.\nMr Langelaan, now in his mid-40s, says he first decided that we needed to return to sail cargo ships when he was in his early 20s.\nAt the time he was working alongside climate researchers and biologists on expeditions to Antarctica, as a crew member on a historical tall sail ship called Bark Europa.\n“If we want to stick to the Paris Agreement on climate change we really need to keep fossil fuels in the ground,” says Ecoclipper’s chief executive.\n“Wind-powered sailing is actually the only feasible way to continue with long-distance transport and travel in the future.”\nThere’s no denying that sailing is slower. Mr Langelaan says it would take 70 days to sail from China to Europe, whereas a modern container ship can do the journey in 30 to 40 days.\nAnd, of course, container ships are enormous – the largest can move 20,500 containers, and a total weight of 210,000 tonnes.\nDe Tukker can only haul a tiny fraction of that with her 70 cubic meters of cargo space, making her a more expensive way to ship cargo.\nYet Mr Langelaan adds that people don’t see the “true ecological price” of container ships. “The price of people falling ill due to the climate change, for instance. That’s never paid for.”\nStephen Gordon is managing director of Clarksons Research, which gives expert analysis of the container shipping sector. He counters that the industry has been investing in more efficient fuel systems, including more than 60% of new ships ordered last year.\nMr Gordon says that some ships have even had small sails fitted, so as to reduce the amount of fuel they need to consume. However, this currently only numbers 50 vessels out of the global total of 100,000.\nTo purchase De Tukker, Ecoclipper raised €600,000 ($663,000; £516,000) through crowdfunding and private investors.\nEcoclipper hopes to build a fleet of up to 25 wind-powered cargo ships in the future, utilising the latest design technology. Each will be 10 times larger than De Tukker, and cost in the region of €9m each.\n“The big goal of Ecoclipper is to connect the continents to offer emission-free cargo shipping,” says Mr Langelaan.\nGavin Allwright is secretary of the International Windship Association, which now has more than 150 members from 50 countries. He says that wind-powered cargo shipping is making a comeback.\n“Since 2012, wind power has been growing,” he says. “It’s a small niche sector but they’re making a comeback in the Western developed world.\n“One driver is the cost of fuel which has been increasing, and carbon taxes are coming in. And there are still vestiges of [historic] sail cargo systems – for example, the Dhows of the Indian Ocean, and some small vessels in operation in areas of the South Pacific.”\nIn the US, a 20m (64ft) steel-hulled schooner sailboat called Apollonia has been transporting cargo up and down the Hudson River in New York State since 2020.\nThe ship’s captain and owner, Sam Merritt, purchased the 77-year-old vessel for $15,000 (£11,500) in 2015, and then spent five years restoring it.\nIt can carry up to 10 US tons (nine metric tonnes) of cargo, and travels for 250 nautical miles between Brooklyn in New York City and the city of Hudson in Upstate New York, and back again. It ships more than 50 products, including barley malt, its biggest cargo, maple syrup and chilli sauce.\nMr Merritt’s previous job had seen him working to develop alternatives to oil for the fuel sector. He turned to shipping after realising that cargo could be transported through sailing.\n“With sailing I can feel good about the whole process,” he says. “I don’t like roads and cars, and as much as I love trying to use vegetable oil for cars, it doesn’t change the system.\n“Sailing cargo really does. I love the relationship with the river. It’s brilliant to slow down and interact with waterfronts, and constantly be part of conversations in towns.”\nNew Tech Economy\nNew Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.\nPresentational grey line\nHowever he says they are not profitable yet. “We are in start-up phase. There’s a lot of obstacles with the infrastructure, but the goal is to be profitable within the next two years, and hopefully that will encourage others to join in.”\nAnother vessel soon to re-join the resurgence in wind-powered cargo sailing is Raybel, a 1920s Thames barge currently being restored in Sittingbourne in Kent.\nOnce the restoration is complete she will transport items like olives, coffee and wine along the Kent coast, and into London. In the ship’s old life, she used to transport bricks along the same route.\n“It’s about utilising traditional UK waterways a lot more, and connecting estuaries to oceans and canals,” says Faye Thorley, project manager for Raybel Charters.\nShe is also the coordinator for two organisations set up to help small-scale producers see their organic, fair-trade goods transported via wind-powered sailing vessels – Sail Cargo London and Kent Sail Cargo.\n“We have a lot of demand but don’t have supply of ships,” says Ms Thorley.\nMr Langelaan is happy to see brands rethink their transport strategies for environmental reasons. “There’s smaller, almost hipster-like companies who are radically deciding they want to reduce their [transport] emissions.”\nHowever, one of the key challenges for cargo sailboats is, of course, the weather. And the longer timeframe.\n“It is weather dependent,” says Ms Thorley. “We are trying to re-educate [trade] customers not to be in a rush for deliveries, and make bulk orders that will last them six months, for example.”\nSource: BBC",

      "articleText": "The world’s largest agricultural trader, Cargill Inc., has retrofitted one of its bulk carriers with two massive steel sails. The sails, called WindWings, are designed to reduce the ship’s fuel use by roughly a fifth.\nThe ship, the Pyxis Ocean, is an 80,000-ton vessel that just completed her maiden voyage between Shanghai and Singapore. The installation of the WindWings, each 37.5 meters (123 feet) high, took place at a Cosco shipyard in Shanghai.\nDesigned by BAR Technologies and produced by Yara Marine Technologies, they say the WindWings can save the ship about 1.5 tons of oil-derived fuel per day. And with these sails, the Pyxis Ocean can save about 1,095 tons of fuel a year, almost 20% of what a Kamsarmax ship typically annually consumes.\nThe shipping industry is a major polluter, emitting about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The International Maritime Organization, the industry’s global regulator, has set a goal of reducing emissions by 50% by 2050.\nWind-assisted propulsion is one of a number of technologies that the shipping industry is exploring to reduce emissions. Other technologies include using alternative fuels, such as biofuels and hydrogen, and improving the efficiency of ships’ engines.\nThe installation of the WindWings on the Pyxis Ocean is a significant step forward for the use of wind power in shipping. It is the first time that a large commercial vessel has been retrofitted with this technology.\nIf the trial on the Pyxis Ocean is successful, it could pave the way for the wider adoption of wind-assisted propulsion in the shipping industry.\nCritics on social media have accused the country’s largest private company of greenwashing, pointing out that the math may not all make sense, considering the weight of the massive sails.\nI assume these things are heavy…that probably puts a drag on delivery time, and creates excess fuel usage ..so I am thinking 1/5 fuel savings may be a bit of greenwashing ..I would like to see full numbers first — Tracy (𝒞𝒽𝒾 ) (@chigrl) August 21, 2023\nSome have also questioned the high cost of installing and maintaining the sails.\nThis is greenwashing. I am a ship designer. The energy this system requires when sailing against the wind + additional weight of the system + permanent ballast beats the savings. Not to mention it costs a fortune to buy, install and maintain it. Hard pass! — anotherHuman 🇺🇦 TeslaQ (@An0th3r_Human) August 21, 2023\nBut Cargill is looking farther ahead.

      "articleText": "A meeting of the so-called Brics nations in Johannesburg this week has led to more media analysis about a developing new world order. Such reviews are often about politics and economics as much as trade and shipping — but it all intersects. Sanctions emanating from the invasion of Ukraine by Russia — a Brics member alongside Brazil, India, China and South Africa — have certainly turned the maritime world upside down and been significant catalysts for change in trade routes and carriers. English-language media still dominate many global conversations but can reflect Western interests and, therefore, give a distorted picture of what is happening on the ground. Like it or not, many countries in the developing world — or Global South — like those around the table in South Africa, do not want to side with the US against Russia over Ukraine. And certainly, the more authoritarian governments of the world are happy to see the Western democratic values championed by Joe Biden challenged. More and more smaller countries do not see a need to choose one side or another as a fragmented — but more complex — world develops. However, this could make finding a consensus for global rule-making over maritime standards or global heating more difficult than ever. China and Brazil have already mounted serious opposition to a carbon emissions levy-based system at the International Maritime Organization. Split with the West Sergei Lavrov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia, is seen during a press conference at the Brics Foreign Ministers meeting in Cape Town.  Photo: Scanpix Russia — as a huge fossil-fuel producer — has rarely shown leadership in tackling climate breakdown whether with shipping or more broadly. Chinese officials themselves have made it known they want to increase their country’s influence in the United Nations, World Trade Organization, G20 and other bodies. China fancies itself as the leader of the Global South and has made friends ... with its heavy investments in Africa and elsewhere as part of the Belt and Road Initiative China fancies itself as the leader of the Global South and has made friends — and the occasional enemy — with its heavy investments in Africa and elsewhere as part of the Belt and Road Initiative. Chinese brokerage house Dongwu Securities said that for the first time ever China shipped more to the developing world — as represented by the countries that make up the Belt and Road — than it exported to the US, Europe and Japan combined, as reported by the Financial Times. Russia has similar but much more modest designs, encouraging developing countries in Africa and elsewhere to see its own split with the West as an opportunity, not a threat. Vladimir Putin has not turned up to the Brics meeting in Sandton outside Johannesburg. This is convenient for his host, President Cyril Ramaphosa, who would have been under pressure to arrest his Russian counterpart for alleged war crimes in Ukraine. The International Criminal Court in The Hague issued an arrest warrant earlier this year, which South Africa would be under obligation to serve. Ramaphosa would not want to do this to another Brics member after giving a raft of mixed messages about whether it actually condemns the attacks on Kyiv or not. Both China and Russia are keen to build Brics into a more significant body. There has even been talk of developing a new Brics currency to — in theory — eventually rival the dollar. Unsurprisingly, other countries hit by Western shipping sanctions such as Iran and Venezuela have publicly stated their interest in joining the trade bloc. Russia has seen its income from oil and gas exports fall under sanctions but continues to find ways of making trade continue overall. In fact, as my colleague Harry Papachristou reported, overall seaborne trade rose by 9.3% in the first half of this year to 526.8m tonnes. Those figures came from Russia’s Federal Agency for Sea and Inland Water Transport, or Rosmorrechflot, which also claimed that liquid cargo from the Azov and Black Sea basin rose by just under 10%. Proxy battles Both Ukraine and Russia have been trying to halt each other’s exports, with Moscow pulling the plug on the Black Sea Grain Initiative. The IMO has already become a place to row about each other’s maritime behaviour. Last week, the Kremlin lodged a formal complaint with the UN body, accusing Kyiv of a “terrorist attack” on a civilian tanker in the Black Sea. This came just days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of firing on a general cargo ship in the same waterway. No shots will be fired at the Brics summit in Johannesburg, but global shipping must be ready for new proxy battles at the IMO and beyond.",

Image: IMO Flickr feed\n\nNautilus was involved in the IMO conference that produced this year's historic international agreement on cutting emissions from shipping. David Appleton explains what was decided and what the implications are for seafarers\n\nDuring a tense week of discussions in early July, the International Maritime Organization finally adopted a revised strategy for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\nThe IMO had been under extreme pressure to produce a strategy more closely aligned to the 2015 Paris Agreement goals after its previous targets were widely panned as unambitious. Those targets were set in 2018, when an initial strategy was agreed to reduce the global shipping industry's total emissions by 50% by 2050, using the 2008 figures as a baseline.\nThe slow pace of change at the IMO, which stems from the need to reach consensus among its 175 member states, has been a cause of considerable frustration for progressive member states and environmental organisations alike – and has led to the threat of regional regulation. This scenario would be an operational nightmare for shipowners, who would be forced to comply with a plethora of differing requirements around the world.\nChanging attitudes, new targets\nHowever, this July saw a seismic shift. The 80th session of the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) adopted the 2023 IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships, which commits IMO member states to a goal of net zero by or around 2050.\nAdditionally, interim targets were adopted – still with a baseline of 2008 emission levels – of a minimum 20% total reduction striving for 30% by 2030, and 70% striving for 80% by 2040. There were also targets agreed to reduce cargo work emissions by 40% and increase the use of zero or near zero emission technologies to a minimum of 5% of the energy used by international shipping by 2030.\nThere has been criticism from some organisations who feel that the measures adopted do not go far enough towards the Paris goal of keeping global temperature rises to below 1.5C, but the revised targets represent a massive increase in the shipping industry's ambition compared to 2018.\nWhat needs to be done now?\nThe scale of the task ahead should not be underestimated. Converting an industry that is currently totally reliant on heavy fuel oil and responsible for 3% of global GHG emissions to a 'net zero' industry within the lifetime of the average general cargo ship will not be an easy feat. There is, after all, little point in agreeing to targets you have no hope of achieving.\nFor the IMO, attention will now turn to developing and finalising the measures necessary to deliver on the reduction targets which will include a goal based marine fuel standard aimed at reducing the GHG intensity of marine fuels and, an economic element comprising of a global GHG pricing mechanism.\nFor Nautilus and our international partners, we can now focus on ensuring that the needs of seafarers are fully taken into account in implementing the required changes.\nA fair deal for those on the front line\nWhilst the industry's strengthened level of ambition is obviously welcome, there are clear safety implications to adopting new technologies before the safety case has been effectively proven – or before seafarers have received the necessary training and upskilling required to work with new machinery and systems.\nThe recent Just Transition Task Force report Mapping a Maritime Just Transition has pointed to the fact that up to 750,000 seafarers will require additional training to handle alternative fuels and technologies by 2050. This will clearly be a herculean task, and a key constraint in implementing the necessary training programmes has been the lack of clarity around the decarbonisation trajectory of the maritime industry.\nThanks to the July 2023 IMO agreement, the uncertainty around the level of ambition has now been removed, but we still do not know how the new targets will be achieved. Which new fuels will prevail, for example, and will radical alternatives like wind power break into the mainstream?\nA commitment to training and safety standards\nAs the industry grapples with these questions, one of the most positive outcomes of MEPC 80 from a seafarer perspective was the commitment to phasing out of GHG emissions in the context of a 'just and equitable transition'. This follows on from the decision approved at the Maritime Safety Committee in June to develop a 'safety regulatory framework to support the reduction of GHG emissions from ships using new technologies and alternative fuels'.\nIn practice, this means that the IMO will need to ensure that measures are put in place to ensure the safety of new fuels, and that necessary amendments are made to the global standards and training convention STCW. However, the industry cannot sit back and wait for regulatory change from the IMO. The targets have been set. It is now time for industry to ensure that seafarers are provided with the skills and training so they can safely deliver them.\n\nWhat is 'net zero'?\n\nNet zero refers to a state in which the greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere are balanced by removal out of the atmosphere. In the context of shipping, one way of achieving this balance could be by using plant-based biofuels, which would absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while growing, even though they would emit CO2 when burnt.\nImage: Getty Images/Marine biology researchers\n\ncan we blow away maritime's carbon crisis?

      "articleText": "Examining responsibility shift, cost-effective alternatives, and innovative battery tech in shipping\nThe International Maritime Organization (IMO) has significantly changed its emissions reduction targets, shifting towards a more ambitious goal of achieving net-zero emissions as close to 2050 as possible. By 2030, member nations have committed to sourcing 5% to 10% of the energy used to power ships from zero to near-zero emission fuels and technologies. These changes vary based on each country’s development classification and economic impact of the maritime sector.\nWhile these revised targets demonstrate a stronger commitment to emissions reduction, they also raise concerns about the availability and feasibility of alternative fuels. And as the responsibility for decarbonization shifts to member participants and shipowners, there is a growing realization that there are few cost-effective tools and practical solutions for reducing emissions in the shipping industry. To gain momentum in reducing shipping-sector emissions, a collaborative, multi-faceted approach is needed to prioritize research and development of low-cost and accessible technologies.\nReassigning the Burden\nThe shift of responsibility from the IMO to individual nations and shipowners has raised concerns regarding the effectiveness of global rules in achieving emissions reduction targets. While differentiated responsibilities based on development and the economic importance of shipping may provide flexibility, critics argue that this moves away from a stringent global rule and poses challenges to keeping global warming below the critical threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius. It calls into question the level of commitment and consistency among associated participants in implementing robust measures to decarbonize their shipping sectors.\nImproving hydrodynamics, enacting energy efficiency measures, and lowering cruising speeds can reduce fuel consumption, but cost-effective alternative fuels are essential to making real progress. The options currently under consideration, such as ammonia, methanol, and hydrogen, still face challenges regarding availability, safe implementation, and carbon-neutral production. These alternatives also require significant production capacity before they can be widely adopted as viable solutions for carbon reduction. Liquid natural gas has been proposed as an interim solution, but that still leaves the industry reliant on fossil fuels and requires shipowners to install emission scrubbing systems.\nInexpensive Tools for Decarbonization\nOne potential avenue for partial emissions reduction is battery storage, which offers a range of benefits. Battery systems can be used for peak shaving at sea, kicking in when more power is needed than can be provided by one engine, but less than generated by two. Battery power can be used for low-speed arrival and departure, reducing the need for ships to switch fuels when approaching port. And batteries can also be used for hotel loads, eliminating the need for diesel generators.\nBut what batteries are suitable? Lithium-ion batteries, despite their widespread use, have certain drawbacks related to cost, flammability, and toxicity. Recent high-profile battery fires on ro-ros and cargo ships are making shipowners and insurers reassess the risks posed by these batteries, highlighting the need for alternative technologies that offer improved safety, environmental sustainability, and performance. Safer options such as flow batteries are too bulky for use on ships, taking away from available cargo space. Fortunately, startups and researchers are working on options that combine safety with high energy densities, and with investment, commercializing these alternatives will allow the shipping industry to accelerate its transition toward net-zero emissions while mitigating the concerns associated with lithium-ion.\nStriking the Balance\nThere’s an axiom that goes “don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” meaning it’s better to do something useful now rather than wait for a perfect solution that may never arrive. With that in mind, the shipping industry should look to strike a balance between its 2050 aspirations and the availability of realistic solutions. While the urgency to combat climate change necessitates bold goals, waiting until a perfect solution is available could put decarbonization efforts further behind schedule. Implementing smaller, incremental changes as they become available will help reduce emissions sooner than later.\nThe shipping industry must allocate resources to support the simultaneous exploration of alternative fuels, advanced propulsion systems, and battery energy storage solutions to bridge the gap between 2023 and 2050. By investing in research and development, the industry can unlock new possibilities and pave the way for innovative technologies that can revolutionize the sector’s decarbonization efforts. These investments will contribute to meeting ambitious targets and foster economic growth and competitiveness in the evolving clean energy landscape.\nMukesh Chatter is the CEO of Alsym Energy, a technology company developing a low-cost, high-performance rechargeable battery chemistry that is free of lithium and cobalt.",

This collaboration marks a significant step forward in addressing these challenges, as it introduces a groundbreaking wind propulsion technology that has the potential to revolutionize the way ships traverse the seas.\n\nThe maritime industry is on a journey to decarbonize—it’s not an easy one, but it is an exciting one.\nJan Dieleman, President of Cargill’s Ocean transportation business\n\nWindWings: Harnessing the Power of Wind\nAt the forefront of this wind-powered revolution is BAR Tech’s WindWings. These cutting-edge wind propulsion devices represent a paradigm shift in the realm of maritime technology. Towering at an impressive height of over 37 m, these WindWings can be seamlessly integrated onto the decks of cargo ships, allowing the vessel to harness the true potential of wind power.1\n\nIf international shipping is to achieve its ambition of reducing CO2 emissions, then innovation must come to the fore. Wind is a near marginal cost-free fuel and the opportunity for reducing emissions, alongside significant efficiency gains in vessel operating costs, is substantial.\nJohn Cooper, Chief Executive Officer, BAR Technologies\n\nThe anticipation surrounding their impact is substantial, especially considering that the IMO just last month adopted an updated GHG strategy for shipping, setting 30% and 80% emissions reduction goals for 2030 and 2040.2\nWith this in mind, these WindWings are projected to achieve remarkable fuel and emissions savings of up to 30% for new vessels, representing a significant stride towards a more environmentally conscious maritime industry.1 Furthermore, the potential synergy with low-carbon fuels hints at even more significant efficiency gains, as Cargill projects approximately 1.5 tonnes of fuel can be saved per WindWing per day.1\nThe First Retrofit: Pyxis Ocean\nMitsubishi Corporation’s flagship vessel, Pyxis Ocean, which has now been reimagined and retrofitted with two towering WindWings, is leading the way for this groundbreaking revolution.\nThis transformation took place in China’s COSCO shipyard, and Pyxis Ocean is currently embarking on its maiden voyage, poised to demonstrate the true capabilities of this innovation in real-world conditions.\nThe insights garnered from Pyxis Ocean’s voyage will play a pivotal role in guiding the technology’s expansion strategy, with Cargill’s vision to adopt it fleet-wide.\nNotably, BAR Technologies and Yara Marine Technologies have already set their sights on an ambitious endeavor, aiming to manufacture hundreds of WindWings within the coming years. This evolution in maritime technology marks a profound step toward greener and more efficient shipping practices, seamlessly blending innovation and environmental responsibility into the fabric of commercial seafaring.\nA Shared Responsibility\nThe collaboration between Cargill and Mitsubishi Corporation underscores a shared commitment to decarbonize the maritime sector. As pioneers in their respective domains, these industry leaders are demonstrating how to tread new waters and invest in innovative solutions. WindWings represent a bridge to sustainability, offering a viable solution to transition existing vessels towards greener practices.\nThe support from the European Union’s CHEK Horizon 2020 initiative further exemplifies the industry’s united commitment to pioneering change.\nThrough innovation and collaboration, these industry leaders are rewriting the narrative of commercial shipping, ushering in an era of unprecedented transformation. As the winds of change fill the sails of progress, WindWings will help to guide the maritime industry towards a horizon defined by innovation, environmental responsibility, and sustainability.\nReferences and Further Reading\n\n“Cargill and Bar Technologies’ Ground-Breaking Wind Technology Sets Sail, Chartering a New Lower-Carbon Path for the Maritime Industry.” (2023) Cargill.

      "articleText": "A growing chorus of climate scientists are asserting that the huge reduction in sulfur emitted by the shipping industry might be a contributing factor to the warming of seas.\n\nNot registered?\n\nReceive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience.\n\nRegister Now\n\nSulfur has long been a dirty word among the shipping community, with concerns about human health, acid rain and environmental damage putting pressure on the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to sharply curb emissions since the early 2000s.\nThe pollutant is perhaps lesser known for its property as a coolant, however, and new research has shown that successful emissions reductions may have inadvertently accelerated the effects of global warming.\n\"SO2 emissions lead to sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, and sulfate aerosols block incoming solar radiation. They have negative radiative forcing [effects] and are therefore a pollutant that historically has partially offset the warming due to greenhouse gases. That means that, while their reduction improves air quality, it also leads to more warming,\" said Timothy Hall, Senior Scientist at The Climate Service, part of S&P Global.\nSince 1997, the IMO has placed limits on the sulfur content of fuel used by ships, with the most drastic measure mandating a 0.5% global sulfur cap from January 1, 2020, known popularly as the IMO 2020.\nUnder IMO 2020, the sulfur content of fuel oil used by a ship was reduced to 0.50% from 3.50%. Ships however can still continue to burn high sulfur fuel oil if they install exhaust cleaning systems, known as scrubbers, to capture sulfur oxide emissions from the ship's engine.\nWhile successful in its aim, IMO 2020 also appears to have had the unintended consequence of reducing the formation of reflective sulfurous clouds over shipping lanes, a phenomenon which previously served as a buffer against the effects of global warming.\n\nNorth Atlantic spike\nA study by Berkeley Earth showed that the effect of removing marine aerosols may have added about 0.02 degrees Celsius to global average temperatures, with a big effect seen in heavy shipping lanes such as the North Atlantic.\n\"Because marine sulfur aerosols have a short-lived cooling effect, their impact is largest close to where they are released, including areas with large number of cargo ships, such as the North Atlantic. Our analysis suggests that removing the sulfur aerosols may have added around 0.25 C to the North Atlantic region,\" Robert Rohde, Lead Scientist at Berkeley Earth.\nMarine sulfur reduction would not explain all of the present North Atlantic spike, but may have added to its severity, added Rohde.\nThe climate science non-profit however acknowledged that the reduction in marine sulfur aerosols from shipping, though regionally significant in areas with high shipping volumes, has likely only added a few hundredths of a degree to the global average temperature.\nThis comes as July 2023 was declared the hottest month on record, with sea surface temperature averaging 0.51 C above the 1991-2020 average, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\nScience of sulfur\nA recent analysis by climate publication Carbon Brief concluded that falling sulfur emissions due to IMO 2020 could result in a 0.05 C rise in global temperatures by 2050, an increase it equates to two additional years of greenhouse gas emissions.\nPiers Forster, Director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate and co-author of the Carbon Brief report, said \"currently there is some still confusion\" within the scientific community on the direct impact this sulfur cap is having on the temperature of oceans.\nBut Forster, who is also a Professor of Physical Climate Change, acknowledged that the IMO controls are expected to instead contribute \"to a small increase in temperatures over time,\" with the lagged result of the 2020 measures likely to only become visible this year.\nThe Carbon Brief study assumed a 33% reduction in sulfur emissions between 2023 and 2050, although it noted that a slower-than expected low-sulfur fuel uptake might result in a weaker warming effect.\nExcess sulfur which is flushed back into the ocean by open loop scrubbers, which form the majority of the 5,000-odd scrubber-fitted vessels globally, would not have the same cooling impact as sulfurous air pollution, Forster said.\nHe clarified that acidic sulfur particles dissolve in alkaline seawater and do not evaporate back into the atmosphere, meaning that the continued use of high sulfur fuel oil as a marine fuel is unlikely to have slowed the warming effect.\n\nFuture pathway\nWhen asked if the IMO was looking at the warming effect caused by its 2020 sulfur cap, a spokesperson at UN agency said the main objective of this regulation was to significantly reduce air pollution.\n\"It is clear that the intention and aim of the 2020 sulfur limit was to protect human health and prevent ocean acidification and reduce significant numbers of premature deaths resulting from air pollution, especially in coastal areas,\" the spokesperson said.\nWhile falling sulfur emissions could increase the onus on the shipping industry to decarbonize more rapidly, industry experts have been careful to avoid taking too narrow a view of IMO caps.\n\"We don't have all the insights on effectiveness of measures from day one,\" said Claudia Beumer, Board Member at the International Bunker Industry Association (IBIA) and Global Account Manager at VT Group.\nShe cited methane slip from LNG-powered ships as another example where seemingly progressive shifts have come with unintended climate consequences -- namely the emission of methane, a more harmful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.\nThe IMO's designation of the Mediterranean Sea as a new Emission Control Area (ECA) Zone will reduce the region's sulfur limit from 0.5% to 0.1% in 2025, but some industry sources speculate that the regulation could mark the last sulfur-focused policy measure.\nInstead, new IMO measures have recently focused on reducing the industry's carbon intensity, energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions.\nMore importantly, the successful management of global warming by the industry is likely to hinge on the uptake of alternative marine fuels such as methanol and ammonia, which have both low carbon and sulfur emissions profiles.\nAccording to forecasts by S&P Global, alternative fuels (excluding LNG) are expected to make up just 2.2% of the fuel mix by 2030, with LNG taking a 7.8% share. The alternative fuels share is expected to jump to 14% in 2050, or 39% in a higher alternative fuels uptake scenario, where regulatory tightening could motivate a faster transition.",

      "articleText": "We round-up the latest environmental developments at US ports.\n\nThe Port of LA, Port of Long Beach and the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), with the support of C40 Cities – a global network of nearly 100 mayors taking action on the climate crisis – has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to establish a green and digital shipping corridor between Singapore and the San Pedro Bay ports complex to support the decarbonisation of the maritime industry and improve efficiencies through digitalisation. “No single port or organisation can tackle the challenge of decarbonising the supply chain alone, no matter how innovative their technology or robust their efforts. The establishment of this green shipping corridor between the San Pedro Bay ports complex and Singapore will prove to be a living, breathing testament to the power of global collaboration,” says Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of LA. Curbing greenhouse gases from international shipping is essential to fight global warming, adds Mario Cordero, executive director of the Port of Long Beach: “Creating this green corridor with our partner ports and C40 Cities is part of our strategy to coalesce all of our efforts here and beyond to help advance our goals for cleaner marine fuels for oceangoing vessels, improve efficiencies for the global movement of goods, and to achieve a carbon-neutral future.” C40 Cities is the facilitator of the green and digital shipping corridor, providing support to the cities, ports, and their corridor partners by coordinating, convening, facilitating and providing communications support in furtherance of the corridor’s goals. Ahead of the revision of the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Initial Strategy for the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships in July 2023, the three ports came together with the C40 Cities network and other stakeholders in the maritime and energy value chains, to jointly accelerate the decarbonisation of the maritime industry in line with the goals of the IMO, and Singapore’s and the US’s respective nationally determined contributions (NDCs) – a climate action plan to cut emissions and adapt to climate impacts. The memorandum also builds on the ports’ longstanding cooperation through platforms such as the Port Authorities’ Roundtable and ChainPort, and complements bilateral initiatives between Singapore and the US, such as the US-Singapore Climate Partnership and the US-Singapore Partnership for Growth and Innovation. The green and digital shipping corridor aims to support the transition to low- and zero-emission fuels by ships calling at Singapore and the San Pedro Bay ports complex. The parties will work to facilitate the supply and adoption of these fuels and explore the necessary infrastructure and regulations for bunkering. In addition to identifying and collaborating on pilot and demonstration projects, the memorandum aims to identify digital shipping solutions and develop standards and best practices for green ports and the bunkering of alternative marine fuels, including sharing experiences at international platforms such as IMO. “The signing of this MOU signals our collective will to pool our resources, technical insights, industry and research networks to deliver scalable green as well as digital corridor solutions to help the maritime industry attain the 2050 emission reduction targets expected of the IMO and help spur the development of green growth opportunities,” says Teo Eng Dih, chief executive of the MPA. OFFSHORE WIND As well as being a part of the above initiative, the Port of Long Beach has also released plans for an ambitious facility to help California and the nation reach renewable energy targets in the coming decades. The floating offshore wind facility, known as Pier Wind, would support the manufacture and assembly of offshore wind turbines as tall as the Eiffel Tower. It would be the largest facility at any US seaport specifically designed to accommodate the assembly of offshore wind turbines. “Imagine fully assembled wind turbines capable of generating 20MW of energy towed by sea from the Port of Long Beach to offshore wind farms in Central and Northern California,” says Cordero. “As society transitions to clean energy, our harbour is ideally located for such an enterprise: with calm seas behind a federal breakwater, one of the deepest and widest channels in the US., direct access to the open ocean and no air height restrictions. No other location has the space to achieve the economies of scale needed to drive down the cost of energy for these huge turbines.” “Building Pier Wind lays the foundation for a zero-carbon energy future, not only for the public but for our operations as well,” says Long Beach Harbor Commission President Sharon L. Weissman. “Offshore wind is essential to the Port of Long Beach’s own goals to transition to zero emissions, and ensuring there is a ready supply of reliable, resilient and renewable power is vital for the work we do moving commerce.” The Pier Wind project helps California harness the powerful wind in deep waters in order to generate renewable energy while enhancing air quality by reducing reliance on fossil fuels; meet the state’s goal of producing 25GW of offshore wind power by 2045; and contribute toward lowering the national cost of offshore wind power by 70% by 2035. The facility would span up to 400 acres of newly built land southwest of the Long Beach International Gateway Bridge within the Harbor District. The port’s concept study provides information to continue planning and discussion with state and federal officials, developers and funders for the $4.7bn project. Pier Wind would also create new jobs and career opportunities for the communities closest to the port that have been disproportionately impacted by climate change and port operations. Community members would participate and benefit as California transitions away from fossil fuels and into a green economy. Construction could potentially start in January 2027, with the first 100 acres operational in early 2031, the second 100 acres operational in late 2031, and the last 200 acres coming online in 2035. SUSTAINABLE AWARD Lineage Logistics, a temperature-controlled industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) and integrated solutions provider, has received a Sustainable Century Award from the Port of Seattle for its environmental leadership and partnership in helping the port achieve its environmental stewardship, sustainability and equity goals. Lineage, a long-time business partner of the port and recipient of the 2022 Maritime Sustainable Century Award for Environmental Performance, operates the seven-building Seattle Garfield facility on Pier 91 in Seattle, Washington. Over the past year, site leaders have implemented significant sustainability initiatives across facilities resulting in a direct, measurable environmental benefit. “As the world’s leading temperaturecontrolled industrial REIT and logistics solutions provider, Lineage has been at the forefront of providing solutions to execute sustainability initiatives throughout the supply chain,” says Chris Thurston, director of energy and sustainability at Lineage Logistics. “We work to strategically integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives into how we do business and live out our values by stewarding the environment, participating in responsible corporate citizenship, and driving innovation in our industry. We are proud to celebrate our long-standing partnership with the Port of Seattle and look forward to collaborating in the years to come to create a more sustainable future.” The Port of Seattle recognised Lineage for investments in energy savings including LED lighting, new control technology and motion sensors throughout buildings 391 and 392 to reduce the percentage of light output when not occupied, installation of three high-speed, roll-up doors in the freezer area of building 390 to minimise how long doors stay open when forklifts are moving between the docks and freezer to drive energy efficiency, and replacing rail doors in buildings 390 and 391 with heavily insulated doors – the new rail dock doors help conserve energy by reducing heat transfer from the freezer. Other notable achievements include installation of variable frequency drives that allow the existing electric compressors to operate more efficiently; installation of two new evaporators with energyefficient technology and variable frequency drives that control the fan motor speed; installation of four new electric heating, ventilation and air-conditioning units to replace natural gas units, and working with consulting and engineering firm Geosyntec on a Storm Water Prevention Plan to help drive efficiencies and reduce environmental impact. In 2022, Lineage committed to achieve net-zero carbon emissions across global operations by 2040. The company is driving efficiencies in reducing energy use as well as investing in renewable energy technologies – including solar generating capacity. Lineage currently ranks as the fifthlargest corporate user of installed, on-site solar capacity, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). Additionally, Lineage plans to release its first-ever sustainability report this year, which will outline many of the steps the company is taking to build a more efficient and sustainable cold chain. HYBRID ENGINES The Georgia Ports Authority (GPA) has agreed to spend $170m on 55 hybridengine Konecranes rubber-tyred gantry (RTG) cranes to outfit the Port of Savannah’s Ocean Terminal, as it is redeveloped into an all-container facility. “This significant investment in new equipment will help prepare the Port of Savannah to handle more ships and cargo while maintaining the world-class service our customers have come to expect,” says GPA executive director Griff Lynch. “[They] will expand our capabilities, operate at lower cost and leave a smaller carbon footprint than conventional diesel cranes.” The hybrid machines will operate off electric battery power exclusively, with diesel generators running only to recharge batteries. This will reduce fuel consumption by an estimated 47% compared to all-diesel machines. Per year, that is a reduction of 8,800 gallons of diesel per crane, or nearly 500,000 gallons annually across the Ocean Terminal fleet. This will result in fuel purchase savings of more than $1.6m per year at current rates. The new cranes reduce emissions by half compared to conventional diesel cranes. At an annual average of 4,000 operating hours per RTG, the hybrid engines will avoid yearly emissions of 127 tons per crane, or nearly 7,000 tons across the 55-RTG fleet. “With every infrastructure expansion, the Georgia Ports Authority seeks to ensure its operations progress toward improved longterm sustainability,” says GPA board chairman Joel Wooten. “Economic development, environmental stewardship, governance, and employee and community engagement are all important facets in that effort.” The gantry cranes will use special ‘whisper’ movement alarms that sound like static, rather than the typical three-tone alarms. The whisper alarms don’t penetrate long distance, but do provide safety for nearby personnel, effectively making the machines quieter and reducing noise emissions. The combination of hybrid power and quieter alarms will help control the sound of operations for neighbouring communities. The new cranes can work stacks that are six containers high and seven wide – one container wider than GPA’s current largest RTGs. Wider stacks mean fewer rows and a denser, more efficient use of space. The RTGs currently serving Ocean Terminal will be repurposed in other areas of operation. The cranes are one part of the renovation of the 200-acre Ocean Terminal. The authority is also establishing two big ship berths at the facility, and improving the paving surface to hold container stacks. These projects will bring to six the number of Neopanamax vessels the Port of Savannah can handle simultaneously. To work the larger ships, GPA will add eight all electric ship-to-shore cranes at Ocean Terminal by 2026. The taller shipto- shore cranes will replace three older cranes that are not suited to handling Neopanamax vessels. When complete, the terminal’s annual capacity will reach two million twenty-foot equivalent container units. A key partner for the Georgia Ports Authority is the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT). It will play an important role in the terminal’s completion and traffic control around Ocean Terminal. “GDOT is currently reviewing plans to route port traffic directly from the terminal onto US 17/Interstate 16, avoiding near-port streets, which could minimise community impacts,” says Susan Gardner, senior director of operations and projects. “Directing trucks in this manner will expedite cargo, while preventing unnecessary traffic in neighbouring communities.”",

      "articleText": "Q&A Bnamericas Published: Friday, August 25, 2023 The prospect of shipbuilding resuming in Brazil mostly as a result of demand from Petrobras is already starting to move the market. Finland's Wärtsilä is keeping a close eye on the order for 25 vessels announced by the state-owned oil company's logistics subsidiary, Transpetro. The engine manufacturer is optimistic about the oil and gas exploration and production market. Wärtsilä's sales manager for marine projects, Luis Grotz, spoke to BNamericas about the business outlook. BNamericas: How do you assess the scenario for shipbuilding for offshore activity in Brazil? Grotz: We have very positive expectations. There’s a new political context encouraging local construction. We also see new [oil and gas] wells being drilled, so we believe this will generate demand for support vessels. And not just from Petrobras, but also from private oil companies. And Wärtsilä is working with its customers to support them in their bids. We’ve also had several meetings with Transpetro, and expectations are very high regarding the tender they are preparing, a package of ships. We believe there will be strong demand for propulsion, generation engines, control bridges, etc. Our portfolio includes everything from the engine room to the gangway. BNamericas: Are customers requesting changes in equipment specifications to reduce pollutant emissions? Grotz: Absolutely. Most companies today are meeting the requirements of the IMO [International Maritime Organization], which sets greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for 2030 and 2040. Our engines will accept various fuels of the future, such as ethanol. Brazil is a major producer of sugarcane, and we see second-generation ethanol as having very good applicability for the shipping sector. We’re going to test an ethanol engine in November, and we believe it will be available on the market next year. BNamericas: What about biodiesel? Grotz: Biodiesel is already a reality. Our engines accept some types of biodiesel without the diesel blend. This applies to both power generation for vessels and propulsion. We’re very focused on biodiesel to serve, for example, the commodities sector, serving river pushers in the northern region. BNamericas: Are hybrid solutions, combining fossil fuels or biofuels and electricity, also on the company's radar? Grotz: Absolutely. Wärtsilä is very strong in the context of electrification. With the battery being fed back by the vessel's engines, you can turn off the engines and use the battery bank to generate energy. This is already a reality. We have a contract with CBO [Companhia Brasileira Offshore, which owns maritime support vessels] and we’re seeing that the market is very focused on this type of development. We believe that electrification is here to stay. We also have a solution that allows oil tankers to be energized during loading or unloading while switching off their diesel engines. Some ports around the world are already prepared for this type of technology, called 'shore connection'. BNamericas: Petrobras is tendering the charter of the Barracuda and Caratinga FPSOs, where the 'all electric' concept will be applied. Is this also a business opportunity for Wärtsilä? Grotz: Although we have a smaller presence in the FPSO segment than in the area of support vessels or rigs, we’re keeping a close eye on it. We’re forerunners in technologies linked to the fuels of the future, so many customers consult us to create their decarbonization paths. So we’re looking very carefully at all these segments.

      "articleText": "in International Shipping News,Shipping: Emission Possible\n25/08/2023\n\nTitan, the independent clean fuel supplier and 123Carbon, the first independent blockchain-based carbon insetting platform for the transport sector are today announcing that they have issued the first LNG-based carbon insets, readily available to the market. Carbon insetting enables fuel suppliers and vessel operators to transfer the environmental benefits of clean, lower carbon intensity fuels throughout the maritime value chain to freight forwarders and shippers.\nCarbon insetting allows carriers to share the carbon reductions of their low carbon activities with freight forwarders and shippers across the global value chain, enabling decarbonisation within their own supply chains. There are, however, strict requirements on the generation and allocation of these insets. These requirements have been defined on a global level by the Smart Freight Centre (SFC), a Netherlands based NGO, which was also involved in the development of the ISO14083-norm for transport carbon accounting earlier this year. Last June, the SFC published their multi-modal Book & Claim methodology, which deals with topics like calculation rules, additionality, allocation and reporting of insetting.\nBased on this global methodology, 123Carbon will issue insets to Titan on its registry, providing the company with immutable and transferable tokens, which Titan can manage using a blockchain wallet and transfer to its customers. Every token issued on the 123Carbon platform contains all information on the emissions reduction project, including the emissions factors used, risk mitigation actions and external assurance – providing a unique level of transparency to the market. 123Carbon also partners with AllChiefs and Verifavia and will provide Titan with a robust, standardised implementation process and assurance protocol.\nTitan, 123Carbon and AllChiefs have collaborated to develop a bespoke approach for (bio-)LNG ship operators and ensure that transparency and inset integrity are guaranteed throughout the entire value chain. One of the results of this approach is that the generated LNG-insets are considered fully additional – one of the most important elements that defines the integrity of an inset. This means that these specific insets were not derived by making use of local incentive schemes such as the Dutch HBE-system, they can be purchased by any party, without any concern of double counting or claiming such reductions.\nTitan was the first marine company to hold a wallet on the 123Carbon insetting platform and, as a result of this partnership has now issued its first tokens for ship operators bunkering lower emission or net zero fuels like LNG or LBM (liquified biomethane/bio-LNG), in line with FuelEU Maritime standards. Titan is actively engaging carriers with an LNG-fleet to tokenise their activities and scale this solution across the market. It is also in active discussions with shippers that are seeking high quality and affordable insets that provide transparency and integrity.\nCaspar Gooren, Director Zero-Carbon at Titan, commented: “Insetting can be an effective means of expediting the energy transition in shipping, which is currently blocked by price levels; fossil fuels remain cheaper than renewable fuels. The insetting system helps to finance this price gap. It forms a new carbon economy: a new system that can incentivise the use of cleaner fuel alternatives.”\n“We are delighted to be working with 123Carbon to help bring this nascent tool for sustainable shipping into the mainstream marine operating environment. Through the leading 123Carbon platform, all partners within its ecosystem can have a significantly positive influence on the decarbonisation of marine supply chains. Titan wants to support and embrace initiatives that improve transparency and allow it to put a better price on carbon reductions as this will trigger vessel owners to further invest in more eco-friendly ships; the upcoming regulations from Europe will further stimulate this as well.”\nJeroen van Heiningen, Co-Founder and Managing Director of 123Carbon added: “The need for carbon insetting is clear. We now need the right tools to generate and transfer these insets safely and transparently. Our platform provides just that. We are pleased to be working with Titan and expand the scope of insets that have been generated on our platform to include LNG and LBM. We are proud to play a part in accelerating the decarbonisation of transportation through our trusted solution and are convinced many other fuel providers and carriers will join our platform in order to share their impact.”\nNicolas Duchêne, President of Verifavia, said: “Transparency stands as a cornerstone advantage of insetting, ensuring financial resources remain within the sector to drive enhancements. Crucially, the accountability and validation of insetting tokens and their value are prioritised, underscoring the need for precise calculations. It remains imperative that the purchase of a token signifies a legitimate reduction of carbon emissions within the sector, aligning fully with greenhouse gas protocols.”\nAllChiefs, the sustainability-centric consultancy, has been advising the partners on how carbon insetting fits, and will fit, within regulations such as FuelEU Maritime and the Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) framework.\nSource: Titan",

Lines, Ltd. (“MOL”), and Osaka Gas Co., Ltd. (“Osaka Gas”) have executed a Project Agreement for the “LP Technology R&D Project” to conduct research and development to demonstrate the technical feasibility and operability of low-pressure and low temperature solutions for the bulk transport of CO2 by ships.\nThe LP Technology R&D Project will involve studying behaviour and boil off characteristics of liquid CO2 under dynamic operating conditions and the impact of non-CO2 components through the following activities. This LP Technology R&D Project will be executed by FEnEx CRC, University of Western Australia, Curtin University, Seoul National University and deepC Store Pty Ltd.\n\nConducting experiments using laboratory scale facilities (such as pressure cell and boil-off apparatus) to study the phase behaviour and boil off characteristics of liquid CO2 under dynamic operating conditions and the impact of non-CO2 components;\nIncorporating new data into custom engineering models for CO2 boil off and phase behaviour calculations developed by the FEnEx CRC and using the new data to test predictions made with existing software tools; and\nDesigning pilot-scale Carbon Capture, Utilisation &/or Storage (CCUS) demonstration tests or project needed to validate the engineering models anchored to laboratory data that can be up-scaled as part of a subsequent project.\n\nThe current design of liquefied CO2 vessels has a limited storage volume due to their operating pressure and temperature (18 bar, -26 °C). Low pressures and low temperatures (approximately 7 bar, -49 °C) are considered one of the best options to significantly reduce costs for CO2 vessel design. However, there is no record of liquefied CO2 transportation by ship under low pressure and low temperatures conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to address operational risks and enhance the likelihood of technical feasibility.\nThrough this LP Technology R&D Project, we aim to mature the technologies needed to safely and efficiently ship large quantities of CO2. Through future demonstration of this LP Technology, we aspire to assist Australia and the broader Asia Pacific region reach Net Zero by linking key emission sources to long-term utilisation and storage solutions.\nComment from FEnEx CRC Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director, Professor Eric May\n“Australia has a unique opportunity to take a leadership role in developing industrial-scale CO2 transport. Successful research in this area will help maximise economic opportunities for Australia as well as forge increased international collaboration and cooperation vital to progressing our decarbonisation goals.”\nComment from JX NOEX Executive Officer, General Manger, Sustainable Business Unit, Yasuto Ariga\n“We will make collaborative efforts with Project partners to develop a feasible CO2 bulk transportation method through this Project. In addition, we are taking this opportunity to build good relationship with industry, government and academia in Australia for its large potential CO2 sequestration capacity, and also promote cooperation with Project partners for realisation of an overseas CCS project.”\nComment from LETA Chief Executive Officer, Mark McCallum\n“LETA has been investing in low emissions technologies for more than a decade to significantly reduce emissions and support the transition to a low emission global economy. LETA is proud to be investing in this project, which can assist in proving up technologies to enable transport of commercial quantities of CO2 from industrial facilities in Asia to storage locations in Australia and to build on the key trading and commercial relationship Australia’s export industries have spent generations building.”\nComment from MOL Executive Officer, Yasuchika Noma\n“We are very honoured and excited to have this opportunity to jointly collaborate with Australian research institutions and Japanese companies to advance the technical and commercial maturation for liquefied CO2 shipping transportation under low pressures and low temperatures. We believe the result of this project can be one step closer to the realisation of a lower carbon future.”\nComment from Osaka Gas Associate Director, Norio Hatanaka\n“Daigas Group declared its commitment to take on the challenge of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 in January 2021. In the “Energy Transition 2030″ formulated in March 2023, we have declared its commitment to contribute to a sustainable society by establishing a CO2 value chain that includes capturing CO2 emitted and reusing it as e-methane, a carbon-neutral synthetic methane, and reducing environmental impact by injection and storage of excess CO2 deep underground. Low pressure and low temperature liquified CO2 is an essential technology for economical CO2 transport. We expect to gain knowledge for handling CO2 under this demonstration condition which we have not experienced before.”\nSource: Mitsui O.S.K.Lines",

One possible approach to meet the emission requirements is to use natural gas as fuel for propulsion and electric power generation onboard.\nUntil recently, there was a lack of international safety requirements for gas as fuel for non- LNG tankers. However, on 1 January 2017, the IGF-Code (International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-Flashpoint Fuels) entered into force.\nThe code provides mandatory provisions for the arrangement and installation of low- flashpoint fuelled machinery.\nDNV updated its Rules to include all statutory requirements (except risk assessment, operational requirements and training). These Rules provide clear and prescriptive criteria together with function based requirements enabling more innovative solutions.\nWhile exploring the details of typical LNG fuel systems this course will show how safety challenges and associated risks are mitigated and minimised through applicable rules and regulations. The course aims to engage technical personnel through discussions and challenging cases giving them a better understanding of LNG as ship fuel.\nObjectives:\nThe course will give the participants an overview of the current developments in the field of LNG as ship fuel.\nThe course focuses on:\n\nApplicable rules and regulations\nSafety challenges and associated risks\nPrinciples and components of typical LNG fuel systems\nShip type considerations\n\nWho should attend:\nTechnical personnel within shipping companies, yards and designers (e.g. engineers, technical directors, fleet managers, superintendents, etc.\nEnrolment Deadline: August 23rd",

      "articleText": "Alisha Fredriksson didn’t expect to be living on a cargo ship this summer. Luckily, she and her team are taking the three-month stints in turns.\nFredriksson is the cofounder and CEO of Seabound, a climate-tech startup that aims to lower the greenhouse-gas emissions produced by the shipping industry.\nSeabound, backed by the famed accelerator Y Combinator, has built a carbon-capture machine that can be retrofitted onto ships. It absorbs CO2 from the exhaust gas and turns it into limestone pebbles, which can then be sold as a building material.\nFrom avocados to clothing, about 90% of traded goods are carried on the ocean. As the backbone of global trade, shipping is responsible for 3% of annual greenhouse-gas emissions — a figure the industry must slash. The UN’s International Maritime Organization recently set a goal for the sector to reach net zero “by or around” 2050.\nNet zero means to balance out the amount of emissions that are emitted with those that are removed from the atmosphere. Shipping, along with aviation and steelmaking, is considered a hard-to-abate industry because of its global complexities and reliance on fossil fuels.\nIt could cost up to $1.9 trillion to decarbonize shipping, a 2020 study by University College London and the environmental consultancy University Maritime Advisory Services found.\n“Shipping now faces a much harder challenge than it would have done had it been better at adapting and improving over the last 10 to 20 years. It’s become very urgent now,” said Stephen Turnock, the head of the engineering school at Southampton University, of the International Maritime Organization’s latest guidance.\nSome form of carbon capture will be needed for shipping to “keep the world spinning” as it moves toward more sustainable practices, said Ed Phillips, a partner at the impact-investment fund Future Planet Capital.\nPiloting the technology on board\nSeabound’s end goal is to capture 95% of the carbon produced by a ship, though its current prototype captures only a small fraction of that. Having tested it on land, Seabound is now using a commercial container ship as its lab in a pilot project with the London-based shipping company Lomar Shipping.\nSeabound moved the prototype from its London research-and-development facility to a shipyard in Yalova, Turkey, where it has been installed on a midsize ship that can carry about 3,200 containers, Fredriksson said. Her team will take turns living on board to test the equipment in a real maritime environment.\nThe equipment connects to the ship’s exhaust, which flows through a reactor full of pebbles made of calcium-oxide – otherwise known as quicklime, limestone without the CO2. Then a mineralization process takes place where carbon dioxide binds to the pebbles to essentially become limestone. The fumes, now cleaner, are released through an outlet pipe. The limestone is temporarily stored on board and replaced with fresh calcium-oxide pebbles when the ship docks.\nThe startup’s opportunity is threefold: Seabound sells the carbon-capture device to ship owners, runs a subscription service for pebble collections to make it easy for shipowners to source new pebbles and offload used ones, and then sells the limestone pebbles to be used as a building material or to be sequestered.\nIf the pilot goes well, the team will start designing and testing a new, bigger version of the device that will be its first product.\n“We will need some time to basically build that first product, so we want to move out of prototyping land and into actually having a product at a meaningful scale for our customers,” Fredriksson said. “Then once we have really tested that on land, that’s when we put the first full-scale version on a ship again.”\nEnergy and weight challenges\nShips usually get lighter through their voyage because they use up fuel, but capturing carbon means storing it on board in some form, which adds weight, according to Turnock. “It might need a little more power to go through the water,” he said.\nIt’s likely a small amount of power, he added, but it’s compounded by the weight and size of the carbon-capture device itself. “If it’s quite heavy, then it usually has to be low down on the ship, and then there might be difficulty to find the necessary volume to actually fit the system in without losing cargo capacity.”\n“Shipowners are loath to lose cargo-carrying capacity because that’s what makes them their money,” Turnock said.\nIn its first pilot, Seabound placed its equipment into five shipping containers stacked on top of each other on the ship. It may require owners to sacrifice “a little bit of cargo” within the ship’s max capacity, and “fuel consumption is relative to that capacity,” Fredriksson said.\nFredriksson added that Seabound’s reaction was exothermic, meaning it needed an injection of heat to get started but then was self-sustaining. It has a “very negligible energy consumption on board,” she said.\nDecarbonization requires all hands on deck\nThere are a handful of other approaches to maritime carbon capture, such as using the captured carbon to charge a CO2 battery, but overall it’s a very nascent space. “It’s not an industry, it’s an emerging category,” Fredriksson said.\n“What’s interesting is that we’re actually all trying different approaches,” she added. “It’s our responsibility as technology innovators or developers to figure out how we can work strategically or creatively within existing infrastructural constraints.”\nFredriksson said there were a host of creative ways being pursued to address the shipping industry’s emissions. “If we were all trying the same thing, it would be kind of silly.”\nCarbon capture aside, electric ships or alternative fuels are favored by others. Maersk, one of the largest container carriers in the world, is betting on green methanol as a fuel, while other startups hope electrification will take off.\n“We’re focused more on the opportunity with e-methanol, with ammonia, hydrogen, and electrification; it’s just avoiding being leapfrogged,” said Future Planet Capital’s Phillips. “As an investor with a long-term view, sometimes backing a technology that solves an issue in the short-term can be a risk in itself.” Still, Seabound’s tech looks “pretty elegant” to the outsider.\nLeapfrogging doesn’t make sense when most ships today run on fossil fuels and are still being ordered, Fredriksson said. Ships typically have a 30-year lifespan, she added. The cost of a complete overhaul to an electric fleet or one that runs on alternative fuel would be “prohibitively expensive” while the technologies themselves are still immature, she added. At scale, Seabound intends to retrofit ships when they are in dry docks for routine maintenance.\nTurnock expects to see a patchwork of technologies emerge. The best solution will depend on whether it’s a short-distance ferry or a cargo ship sailing the high seas, he said. “I don’t think there’s a magic bullet out there.”\n“We should be thinking about solutions which are overall good for the environment and make sense, not just ways of bookkeeping CO2 so we’re just displacing the problem,” he added.\nSource: Business Insider",

      "articleText": "A growing chorus of climate scientists are asserting that the huge reduction in sulfur emitted by the shipping industry might be a contributing factor to the warming of seas.\nSulfur has long been a dirty word among the shipping community, with concerns about human health, acid rain and environmental damage putting pressure on the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to sharply curb emissions since the early 2000s.\nThe pollutant is perhaps lesser known for its property as a coolant, however, and new research has shown that successful emissions reductions may have inadvertently accelerated the effects of global warming.\n“SO2 emissions lead to sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, and sulfate aerosols block incoming solar radiation. They have negative radiative forcing [effects] and are therefore a pollutant that historically has partially offset the warming due to greenhouse gases. That means that, while their reduction improves air quality, it also leads to more warming,” said Timothy Hall, Senior Scientist at The Climate Service, part of S&P Global.\nSince 1997, the IMO has placed limits on the sulfur content of fuel used by ships, with the most drastic measure mandating a 0.5% global sulfur cap from January 1, 2020, known popularly as the IMO 2020.\n\nUnder IMO 2020, the sulfur content of fuel oil used by a ship was reduced to 0.50% from 3.50%. Ships however can still continue to burn high sulfur fuel oil if they install exhaust cleaning systems, known as scrubbers, to capture sulfur oxide emissions from the ship’s engine.\nWhile successful in its aim, IMO 2020 also appears to have had the unintended consequence of reducing the formation of reflective sulfurous clouds over shipping lanes, a phenomenon which previously served as a buffer against the effects of global warming.\nNorth Atlantic spike\nA study by Berkeley Earth showed that the effect of removing marine aerosols may have added about 0.02 degrees Celsius to global average temperatures, with a big effect seen in heavy shipping lanes such as the North Atlantic.\n“Because marine sulfur aerosols have a short-lived cooling effect, their impact is largest close to where they are released, including areas with large number of cargo ships, such as the North Atlantic. Our analysis suggests that removing the sulfur aerosols may have added around 0.25 C to the North Atlantic region,” Robert Rohde, Lead Scientist at Berkeley Earth.\nMarine sulfur reduction would not explain all of the present North Atlantic spike, but may have added to its severity, added Rohde.\n\nThe climate science non-profit however acknowledged that the reduction in marine sulfur aerosols from shipping, though regionally significant in areas with high shipping volumes, has likely only added a few hundredths of a degree to the global average temperature.\nThis comes as July 2023 was declared the hottest month on record, with sea surface temperature averaging 0.51 C above the 1991-2020 average, according to the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service.\nScience of sulfur\nA recent analysis by climate publication Carbon Brief concluded that falling sulfur emissions due to IMO 2020 could result in a 0.05 C rise in global temperatures by 2050, an increase it equates to two additional years of greenhouse gas emissions.\nPiers Forster, Director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate and co-author of the Carbon Brief report, said “currently there is some still confusion” within the scientific community on the direct impact this sulfur cap is having on the temperature of oceans.\nBut Forster, who is also a Professor of Physical Climate Change, acknowledged that the IMO controls are expected to instead contribute “to a small increase in temperatures over time,” with the lagged result of the 2020 measures likely to only become visible this year.\n\nThe Carbon Brief study assumed a 33% reduction in sulfur emissions between 2023 and 2050, although it noted that a slower-than expected low-sulfur fuel uptake might result in a weaker warming effect.\nExcess sulfur which is flushed back into the ocean by open loop scrubbers, which form the majority of the 5,000-odd scrubber-fitted vessels globally, would not have the same cooling impact as sulfurous air pollution, Forster said.\nHe clarified that acidic sulfur particles dissolve in alkaline seawater and do not evaporate back into the atmosphere, meaning that the continued use of high sulfur fuel oil as a marine fuel is unlikely to have slowed the warming effect.\nFuture pathway\nWhen asked if the IMO was looking at the warming effect caused by its 2020 sulfur cap, a spokesperson at UN agency said the main objective of this regulation was to significantly reduce air pollution.\n“It is clear that the intention and aim of the 2020 sulfur limit was to protect human health and prevent ocean acidification and reduce significant numbers of premature deaths resulting from air pollution, especially in coastal areas,” the spokesperson said.\nWhile falling sulfur emissions could increase the onus on the shipping industry to decarbonize more rapidly, industry experts have been careful to avoid taking too narrow a view of IMO caps.\n“We don’t have all the insights on effectiveness of measures from day one,” said Claudia Beumer, Board Member at the International Bunker Industry Association (IBIA) and Global Account Manager at VT Group.\nShe cited methane slip from LNG-powered ships as another example where seemingly progressive shifts have come with unintended climate consequences — namely the emission of methane, a more harmful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.\nThe IMO’s designation of the Mediterranean Sea as a new Emission Control Area (ECA) Zone will reduce the region’s sulfur limit from 0.5% to 0.1% in 2025, but some industry sources speculate that the regulation could mark the last sulfur-focused policy measure.\nInstead, new IMO measures have recently focused on reducing the industry’s carbon intensity, energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions.\nMore importantly, the successful management of global warming by the industry is likely to hinge on the uptake of alternative marine fuels such as methanol and ammonia, which have both low carbon and sulfur emissions profiles.\nAccording to forecasts by S&P Global, alternative fuels (excluding LNG) are expected to make up just 2.2% of the fuel mix by 2030, with LNG taking a 7.8% share. The alternative fuels share is expected to jump to 14% in 2050, or 39% in a higher alternative fuels uptake scenario, where regulatory tightening could motivate a faster transition.\nSource: Platts",

      "articleText": "It may sound like a step back in time, but shipping has discovered sails. A cargo ship has been fitted with cutting-edge, so-called \"wind propulsion\" units. Called WindWings, the large wing sails measuring up to 37.5 metres in height and can be added to the deck of commercial vessels. Mitsubishi Corporation’s Pyxis Ocean, chartered by US global food corporation Cargill, is the first vessel to be retrofitted with two WindWings. Produced by industrialisation partner Yara Marine Technologies, they are expected to generate average fuel savings of up to 30 percent on new build vessels, which could be even higher if used in combination with alternative fuels. The installation of the wings took place at the COSCO shipyard in China and the Pyxis Ocean is now on the water, conducting her maiden voyage. Jan Dieleman, President of Cargill’s Ocean Transportation business, explains: \"The maritime industry is on a journey to decarbonise—it's not an easy one, but it is an exciting one. \"At Cargill we have a responsibility to pioneer decarbonising solutions across all our supply chains to meet our customer’s needs and the needs of the planet. \"A technology like WindWings doesn’t come without risk, and as an industry leader – in partnership with visionary shipowner Mitsubishi Corporation - we are not afraid to invest, take those risks and be transparent with our learnings to help our partners in maritime transition to a more sustainable future.\" The installation demonstrates a step-change in attitudes towards technologies that can enable an energy transition for existing vessels. The WindWings project, which is co-funded by the European Union as part of the CHEK Horizon 2020 initiative, seeks to help the industry meet zero emissions targets by offering a retrofit solution that is capable of decarbonising existing vessels, which is particularly relevant given that 55 percent of the world’s bulker fleets are up to nine years in age. The performance of the WindWings will be closely monitored over the coming months to further improve their design, operation, and performance, with the aim that the Pyxis Ocean will be used to inform the scale-up and adoption across not only Cargill’s fleet but the industry. BAR Technologies and Yara Marine Technologies are already planning to build hundreds of wings over the next four years and BAR Technologies is also researching newbuilds with improved hydrodynamic hull forms. John Cooper, Chief Executive Officer, BAR Technologies, says: \"If international shipping is to achieve its ambition of reducing CO2 emissions, then innovation must come to the fore. \"Wind is a near marginal cost-free fuel and the opportunity for reducing emissions, alongside significant efficiency gains in vessel operating costs, is substantial. \"Today is the culmination of years of pioneering research, where we’ve invested in our unique wind sail technology and sought out a skilled industrialisation partner in Yara Marine Technologies, in order to provide vessel owners and operators with an opportunity to realise these efficiencies.\" The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set ambitious goals in the fight against pollution and climate change. The main one aims for reduction of carbon intensity of all ships by at least 40% by 2030 and a targeted 70% decrease by 2050 compared to 2008 baseline. WindWings aim to help vessel owners meet new efficiency rules. As wind power is not only zero emissions but is also non-depleting and predictable, it offers significant efficiency gains in vessel operating costs. According to a Cagill release, on an average global route, WindWings can save 1.5 tonnes of fuel per WindWing per day - with the possibility of saving more on trans ocean routes. This can translate into vessel owners saving heavy fuel oil (HFO) of around $800 per tonne, which will become even more important when saving against future fuels which will undoubtedly cost a lot more.",

      "articleText": "Alisha Fredriksson didn’t expect to be living on a cargo ship this summer. Luckily, she and her team are taking the three-month stints in turns.\nFredriksson is the cofounder and CEO of Seabound, a climate-tech startup that aims to lower the greenhouse-gas emissions produced by the shipping industry.\nSeabound, backed by the famed accelerator Y Combinator, has built a carbon-capture machine that can be retrofitted onto ships. It absorbs CO2 from the exhaust gas and turns it into limestone pebbles, which can then be sold as a building material.\nFrom avocados to clothing, about 90% of traded goods are carried on the ocean. As the backbone of global trade, shipping is responsible for 3% of annual greenhouse-gas emissions — a figure the industry must slash. The UN’s International Maritime Organization recently set a goal for the sector to reach net zero “by or around” 2050.\nNet zero means to balance out the amount of emissions that are emitted with those that are removed from the atmosphere. Shipping, along with aviation and steelmaking, is considered a hard-to-abate industry because of its global complexities and reliance on fossil fuels.\nIt could cost up to $1.9 trillion to decarbonize shipping, a 2020 study by University College London and the environmental consultancy University Maritime Advisory Services found.\n“Shipping now faces a much harder challenge than it would have done had it been better at adapting and improving over the last 10 to 20 years. It’s become very urgent now,” said Stephen Turnock, the head of the engineering school at Southampton University, of the International Maritime Organization’s latest guidance.\nSome form of carbon capture will be needed for shipping to “keep the world spinning” as it moves toward more sustainable practices, said Ed Phillips, a partner at the impact-investment fund Future Planet Capital.\nPiloting the technology on board\nSeabound’s end goal is to capture 95% of the carbon produced by a ship, though its current prototype captures only a small fraction of that. Having tested it on land, Seabound is now using a commercial container ship as its lab in a pilot project with the London-based shipping company Lomar Shipping.\nSeabound moved the prototype from its London research-and-development facility to a shipyard in Yalova, Turkey, where it has been installed on a midsize ship that can carry about 3,200 containers, Fredriksson said. Her team will take turns living on board to test the equipment in a real maritime environment.\nThe equipment connects to the ship’s exhaust, which flows through a reactor full of pebbles made of calcium-oxide – otherwise known as quicklime, limestone without the CO2. Then a mineralization process takes place where carbon dioxide binds to the pebbles to essentially become limestone. The fumes, now cleaner, are released through an outlet pipe. The limestone is temporarily stored on board and replaced with fresh calcium-oxide pebbles when the ship docks.\nThe startup’s opportunity is threefold: Seabound sells the carbon-capture device to ship owners, runs a subscription service for pebble collections to make it easy for shipowners to source new pebbles and offload used ones, and then sells the limestone pebbles to be used as a building material or to be sequestered.\nIf the pilot goes well, the team will start designing and testing a new, bigger version of the device that will be its first product.\n“We will need some time to basically build that first product, so we want to move out of prototyping land and into actually having a product at a meaningful scale for our customers,” Fredriksson said. “Then once we have really tested that on land, that’s when we put the first full-scale version on a ship again.”\nEnergy and weight challenges\nShips usually get lighter through their voyage because they use up fuel, but capturing carbon means storing it on board in some form, which adds weight, according to Turnock. “It might need a little more power to go through the water,” he said.\nIt’s likely a small amount of power, he added, but it’s compounded by the weight and size of the carbon-capture device itself. “If it’s quite heavy, then it usually has to be low down on the ship, and then there might be difficulty to find the necessary volume to actually fit the system in without losing cargo capacity.”\n“Shipowners are loath to lose cargo-carrying capacity because that’s what makes them their money,” Turnock said.\nIn its first pilot, Seabound placed its equipment into five shipping containers stacked on top of each other on the ship. It may require owners to sacrifice “a little bit of cargo” within the ship’s max capacity, and “fuel consumption is relative to that capacity,” Fredriksson said.\nFredriksson added that Seabound’s reaction was exothermic, meaning it needed an injection of heat to get started but then was self-sustaining. It has a “very negligible energy consumption on board,” she said.\nDecarbonization requires all hands on deck\nThere are a handful of other approaches to maritime carbon capture, such as using the captured carbon to charge a CO2 battery, but overall it’s a very nascent space. “It’s not an industry, it’s an emerging category,” Fredriksson said.\n“What’s interesting is that we’re actually all trying different approaches,” she added. “It’s our responsibility as technology innovators or developers to figure out how we can work strategically or creatively within existing infrastructural constraints.”\nFredriksson said there were a host of creative ways being pursued to address the shipping industry’s emissions. “If we were all trying the same thing, it would be kind of silly.”\nCarbon capture aside, electric ships or alternative fuels are favored by others. Maersk, one of the largest container carriers in the world, is betting on green methanol as a fuel, while other startups hope electrification will take off.\n“We’re focused more on the opportunity with e-methanol, with ammonia, hydrogen, and electrification; it’s just avoiding being leapfrogged,” said Future Planet Capital’s Phillips. “As an investor with a long-term view, sometimes backing a technology that solves an issue in the short-term can be a risk in itself.” Still, Seabound’s tech looks “pretty elegant” to the outsider.\nLeapfrogging doesn’t make sense when most ships today run on fossil fuels and are still being ordered, Fredriksson said. Ships typically have a 30-year lifespan, she added. The cost of a complete overhaul to an electric fleet or one that runs on alternative fuel would be “prohibitively expensive” while the technologies themselves are still immature, she added. At scale, Seabound intends to retrofit ships when they are in dry docks for routine maintenance.\nTurnock expects to see a patchwork of technologies emerge. The best solution will depend on whether it’s a short-distance ferry or a cargo ship sailing the high seas, he said. “I don’t think there’s a magic bullet out there.”\n“We should be thinking about solutions which are overall good for the environment and make sense, not just ways of bookkeeping CO2 so we’re just displacing the problem,” he added.\nSource: Business Insider",

However, with the use of the most cost-effective feedstocks and improvements in production processes, it is possible to reduce the cost of renewable methanol production. This can be achieved through biomass or MSW gasification, or by using CO2 and renewable hydrogen.

The current production costs for natural gas and coal-based methanol are between USD 100-250/t. However, with the use of the most cost-effective feedstocks and improvements in production processes, it is possible to reduce the cost of renewable methanol production. This can be achieved through biomass or MSW gasification, or by using CO2 and renewable hydrogen. With these advancements, the cost of producing renewable methanol could become comparable to the cost of methanol from fossil fuels.

      "articleText": "Hello Queseanians,\nThe 2023 IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships (the 2023 IMO GHG\nStrategy) adopted in July 2023, represents the continuation of work by IMO as the appropriate international body to address greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping.\nIMO has agreed to keep the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy under review with a view to adoption of a revised IMO GHG Strategy in 2028. The strategy aims to achieve net-zero GHG emissions from international shipping by around 2050 and promote the use of alternative zero and near-zero GHG fuels by 2030. It also includes checkpoints for reducing emissions by 2030 and 2040.\nIMO emphasizes the importance of supporting developing countries in this transition. Industry response has been positive, with calls for urgent supply of zero GHG marine fuels and a global levy on ships’ GHG emissions.

      "articleText": "EU ETS Loophole or How the EU ETS compliance cost can be reduced significantly\nA. Background\nStarting in 2024, the EU ETS requires commercial ships above 5,000 GT to adhere to specific emission surrender requirements for different types of voyages.\n\n50% of emissions apply to ships departing from an EU/EEA port and arriving at a non-EU/EEA port.\n50% of emissions apply to ships arriving at an EU/EEA port from a non-EU/EEA port.\n100% of emissions apply to ships performing voyages between EU/EEA ports.\n100% of emissions apply to ships at berth in an EU/EEA port.\n\nThe EU ETS regulations apply to the following port calls having commercial operation:\n\nports of call from and to all EU Member States,\nports of call from and to the nine EU outermost regions (Açores, Madeira, Canarias, Guadeloupe, French Guyana, Martinique, Mayotte, Saint Martin, and Reunion)\nports of call from and to EEA States (Norway, Iceland).\n\nCurrently, the price of carbon permits on the EU carbon market is 90 € per tonne of CO2 and is expected to  potentially increase in the future.\nB. Are ship-to-ship transfers considered ports of call according to EU legislation?\nAccording to Article 3 of the EU MRV/ETS Regulation:\n\nShip-to-ship transfers within the port limits of a non-EU/EEA Member State are considered “ports of call”.\nShip-to-ship transfers outside the port limits of a non-EU/EEA Member State are NOT considered “ports of call”.\n\nC. Equations\nThe CO2 emissions are calculated based on the following equation:\n\nThe allowances to be surrendered are calculated based on the following equation:\n\nD. Vessel Description\nFor the scope of the current study we selected a modern SOx scrubber-fitted suezmax tanker sailing on an average speed of 12 knots with an approximate daily consumption of 40 tonnes in laden condition.\nE. Now let’s explore a potential loophole in the EU ETS Regulation with two case studies.\nThere are countries adjacent to the EU that are not EU Member States, such as Montenegro, Albania, Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria.\n\nCase Study 1 (Saudi Arabia to Italy and Saudi Arabia to Italy via Albania)\n\nAssuming that the subject suezmax tanker needs to transport a certain amount of crude oil from Ras Tanura, Saudi Arabia (non-EU/EEA), to Trieste, Italy (EU).\nThe voyage from the departing port of Ras Tanura, Saudi Arabia (non-EU/EEA) to the arrival port of Trieste, Italy (EU) sailing on an average speed of 12 knots lasts approxi-mately 16 days. For this voyage, the ship will have approximately 640 tonnes of heavy fuel oil consumed. The CO2 emissions for this amount of fuel oil are equal to 1,992.96 tonnes. Taking into account that 50% of emissions apply to ships arriving at an EU/EEA port from a non-EU/EEA port, the emissions under the EU ETS to be considered are  996.48 tonnes of CO2. Therefore, the overall expenditure increase due to the EU ETS compliance cost for this voyage is equal to  89,683 €.\n\nBut consider an alternative scenario:\nAn alternative pathway for the crude oil to be transported starting from Ras Tanura, Saudi Arabia (non-EU/EEA) and arrive at the final port of destination Trieste, Italy (EU) via an intermediate call to a Floating Storage Offloading (FSO) unit within the port limits of Vlore, Albania (non-EU/EEA). We assume that another suezmax tanker loads the cargo from the FSO unit and transports the cargo to the final destination of Trieste, Italy (EU).\n\nIn this case, the voyage leg breaks into the following two parts:\na.\tRas Tanura, Saudi Arabia – Vlore, Albania\nFor this part, none of these two ports are EU/EEA, therefore there is no need to surrender any allowances for the EU ETS scheme.\nb.\tVlore, Albania – Trieste, Italy\nFor this part, the CO2 emissions for this amount of fuel oil (80 tonnes) are equal to 249.12 tonnes. Taking into account that 50% of emissions apply to ships arriving at an EU/EEA port from a non-EU/EEA port, the emissions under the EU ETS to be considered are 124.56 tonnes of CO2.Therefore, the overall expenditure increase due to the EU ETS compliance cost for this voyage is equal to 11,210 €.\nIn the alternative scenario, the EU ETS compliance cost to transport the same amount of cargo between the same departure port and final destination port is reduced by 88% and the allowances to be surrendered are only 11,210 €.\n\nCase Study 2 (Nigeria to Portugal or Nigeria to Portugal via Morocco)\n\nAssuming that the subject suezmax tanker needs to transport a certain amount of crude oil from Bonny, Nigeria (non-EU/EEA) to Sines, Portugal (EU).\nThe voyage from the departing port of Bonny, Nigeria (non-EU/EEA) to the arrival port of Sines, Portugal (EU) sailing on an average speed of 12 knots lasts approximately 13 days. For this voyage, the ship will have approximately 520 tonnes of heavy fuel oil con-sumed. The CO2 emissions for this amount of fuel oil are equal to 1,619.28 tonnes.  Taking into account that 50% of emissions apply to ships arriving at an EU/EEA port from a non-EU/EEA port, the emissions under the EU ETS to be considered are  809.64 tonnes of CO2. Therefore, the overall expenditure increase due to the EU ETS compliance cost for this voyage is equal to 72,868 €.\n\nBut consider an alternative scenario:\nAn alternative pathway for the crude oil to be transported starting from Bonny, Nigeria (non-EU/EEA) and arrive at the final port of destination Sines, Portugal (EU) via an intermediate call to a Floating Storage Offloading (FSO) unit within the port limits of Tanger, Morocco (non-EU/EEA). We assume that another suezmax tanker loads the cargo from the FSO unit and transports the cargo to the final destination of Sines, Portugal (EU).\n\nIn this case, the voyage leg breaks into the following two parts:\na.\tBonny, Nigeria – Tanger, Morocco\nFor this part, none of these two ports are EU/EEA, therefore there is no need to surrender any allowances for the EU ETS scheme.\nb.\tTanger, Morocco – Sines, Portugal\nFor this part, the CO2 emissions for this amount of fuel oil (40 tonnes) are equal to 124.56 tonnes. Taking into account that 50% of emissions apply to ships arriving at an EU/EEA port from a non-EU/EEA port, the emissions under the EU ETS to be considered are 62.28 tonnes of CO2. Therefore, the overall expenditure increase due to the EU ETS compliance cost for this voyage is equal to\n5,605 €.\nIn the alternative scenario, the EU ETS compliance cost to transport the same amount of cargo between the same departure port and final destination port is reduced by 92% and the allowances to be surrendered are only 5,605 €.\nConclusion / Implications\nThe conclusion is straightforward.\nThe EU ETS compliance cost is significantly reduced if intermediate calls in non-EU countries neighboring EU Member states are introduced.\nThis loophole might be considered a business opportunity for several parties (non-EU countries, ship management companies, oil trading companies) and lead to a change in the oil import/transportation landscape of Europe, revenue loss for the EU ETS and carbon leakage.\nAnnex\n\nNote:\nDistance calculations for the voyages and screenshots were made using https://app.searoutes.com/\nDownload the full Article here:\nQueseas - EU ETS Regulation Loophole.pdf (1.0 MB)",

What are the problems you have encountered?\n\nHello @Iro\nOnshore power supply is viewed by some as a practical approach to curbing emissions in ports, while others have faced difficulties in its execution.\nABB’s turnkey solution serves as a prime example of successful implementation.\nShore-to-ship - Article from ABB review.pdf (1.2 MB)\nThe European Onshore Power Supply Association (EOPSA) advocates for the interests of an entire ecosystem consisting of energy companies, port authorities, and maritime operators.\nThe advantages of onshore power supply extend to both port authorities and vessel owners, providing both environmental and economic benefits. Nevertheless, there may be safety challenges that need addressing, requiring solutions to ensure secure implementation.\n\nSafety concerns regarding onshore power supply in ports for ships encompass\n\nfire hazards,\nelectrical hazards,\npotential risks associated with equipment failure and\nimproper connections between the ship and shore power supply.\n\nTo ensure safe installation and operation of onshore power supply systems, guidelines and standards have been developed.\nIMO approved in June 2023 the MSC.1/Circ.1675 on Interim guidelines on safe operation of onshore power supply (OPS) service in port for ships engaged on international voyages, which detail possible means of mitigating hazards to guarantee secure and reliable system operation.\nProper equipment use and personnel training can also help mitigate potential risks linked to onshore power supply implementation.\n\nIro\n\nJuly 4, 2023,  4:02pm\n3\n\nI am actually trying to find the latest msc circular but haven’t been able until now.\nOne thing that concerns me regarding the ops is that there is a lot of miscommunication even in its name. Cold ironing, alternative maritime power (amp), onshore power supply (ops), shore side electricity (sse). They all are basically the same thing. So it’s not very well defined. It is even less well defined when we are considering technical specifications for low voltage shore connection.\nI was also wondering if there is actual onboard experience on this.\n\nThe circular is approved during MSC.107 but not published yet. You can find the draft text of the circular in annex 20 of the report of SSE 9-20 (Sub-Committe on Ship Systems and Equipment). I understand that the draft text is approved without any changes.",

However, a confirmation from the OEM on the capability of the engines to burn the proposed biofuels and a no-objection confirmation letter is required. For blends with more than 30% of biofuel, NOx re-measurement might be necessary depending on whether the biofuel can be burnt without changes to the NOx critical components or settings.\nFor more than 30% biofuel, the Flag Administration should be contacted to check the application under the regulations of MARPOL Annex VI and ask for further guidance.\nAlso, for the class, a risk assessment should be conducted showing that risk control measures are in place in case of engine failure or fuel-related issues.\nIn any case, an implementation plan for the use of biofuels and change-over requirements in their Safety Management System and crew familiarization is required.\nmepc1circ795rev7.pdf (208.0 KB)",

If the propeller shaft speed falls below the minimum RPM limit, the generator may not be able to produce enough power to meet the ship’s electrical demands.\nThis can result in a loss of power to critical systems, such as navigation or communication equipment, and can potentially compromise the safety of the vessel.\nThe upper RPM limit is set to prevent the generator from overloading and damaging the system. If the propeller shaft speed exceeds the maximum RPM limit, the generator may produce an excessive amount of power, which can lead to overheating and damage to the generator or other electrical components on the ship.\nThis is why the shaft generators are usually disengaged when they reach the lower or upper RPM limits and the standby generators must start.",

      "articleText": "Maritime trades have been powered by residual fuels that emit high levels of air pollutants and greenhouse gases for decades, but a growing number of regulators are pushing vessel operators to use greener energy sources.\nHaving lowered the global sulfur cap for bunker fuels earlier this decade, the International Maritime Organization has set decarbonization targets for cross-border shipping in the coming decades on the way to net-zero emissions close to 2050 and plans to introduce GHG rules for marine fuels in phases.\nWith civil society pressuring governments and businesses to act on climate change, the UN agency has emerged as the main driving force for low-carbon shipping with insufficient voluntary efforts from the private sector, said Adrian Tolson, owner of consultancy 2050 Marine Energy.\n“Despite some corporations being outliers, it’s not realistic to see shipping decarbonize itself out of the goodness of its heart and its concern for environment,” Tolson told S&P Global Commodity Insights. “A level playing field for all owners and operators is essential, and this only comes with clear consistent and preferably global regulation.”\nOther industry participants said various regional and national governments are also developing maritime emission regulations, with the EU taking the lead in promoting GHG cuts from vessel operations.\nBrussels is scheduled to extend the Emissions Trading System to cover shipping from 2024 and usher in GHG intensity requirements for marine energy from 2025, and both sets of rules will cover voyages to, from and between EU ports.\n\n“Whilst there is variation globally, overall, the political and societal pressure for the world to decarbonize is high and we can see this in the regulatory development activity in IMO and the EU,” Lloyd’s Register’s head of regulatory affairs, Andrew Sillitoe, said.\nClick to explore this infographic: Regulators aim to drive green transition of marine fuels\nChanging focus\nShipping regulations have the ability to shake up the bunker market dynamics, as shown by the IMO rules requiring vessels to burn fuels with 0.5%S limits instead of 3.5%S from 2020 except for those with scrubbers.\nVery low sulfur fuel oil didn’t exist commercially before the turn of the decade. But the 0.5%S fuel’s consumption reached 143.1 million mt globally in 2022, or nearly 45% of total bunker demand, according to S&P Global data.\nAside from some emission control areas with 0.1%S requirements, major regulatory pieces will focus on GHG reduction through the 2020s and beyond, industry participants said.\n“The pressure to reduce sulfur oxide emissions from shipping further has reduced [following IMO 2020],” said Sillitoe, adding that SOx is a local pollutant affecting coastal areas whereas climate change is a global issue.\nThe shifting focus comes as average global temperature continues to rise, with the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration describing July as “likely Earth’s warmest month” on record.\n“There is a very clear scientific rationale that requires deep GHG reduction,” said Tristan Smith, co-founder of consultancy UMAS. “Climate impacts are already affecting every country, some catastrophically, and this creates strong political pressure for governments to take action.”\nIn their Higher Uptake case assuming more decarbonization efforts by governments and businesses, S&P Global analysts expect low-carbon bunker demand to increase from 845,000 mt last year to 12.5 million in 2030 before a further jump to 116.5 million mt in 2050. This would suggest their share in total marine energy would rise from 0.3% in 2022 to 3.8% in 2030 and 39.3% in 2050.\nMajor hubs\nSome major bunker hubs have sought to position themselves for the evolving bunker mix, developing refueling standards and providing financial incentives for new types of marine fuels during the low-carbon transition.\nRotterdam, Europe’s largest and the world’s No. 2 hub, already saw 9% of its bunker sales last year from alternative fuels like LNG, bio-blends and methanol — which have lower carbon intensity than oil-based fuels but are not necessarily low-carbon fuels.\nThe world’s top refueling port, Singapore, reported alternative fuels made up 0.3% of its sales in 2022. But bio-blended sales hit a monthly record high and LNG sales surged in July as the first methanol transaction occurred, according to data from the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore.\n“Some ports are clearly more engaged than others,” Tolson said. “Singapore was perhaps behind Rotterdam for some time, but with the power of the Singapore government they are clearly catching up.”\nDespite stating its ambition for a low-carbon transition, Fujairah — the world’s No. 3 — didn’t record any alternative bunker sale last year. “Perhaps they are waiting for commercial interests to do the heavy lifting,” Tolson said.\nHaris Zografakis, partner of law firm Stephenson Harwood, suggested future bunker ports are likely to require new, specialist bunkering facilities.\n“The scale of the investment needed will be considerable, and it remains to be seen whether the public and private investments needed will materialize,” Zografakis said.\nBunker ports’ ability to access future low-carbon fuels have also been in focus, as the trading routes of “green” methanol and ammonia are expected to differ from oil-based fuels with the Global South potentially emerging as production centers.\n“Whether Singapore, Rotterdam and Fujairah remain relevant as bunkering points will [be determined by] how proactively they engage in the energy transition, as well as how the supply chains for new energy commodities develop over time,” Smith said.\nSource: Platts",

The agreement states that traders leasing a vessel should not cause its carbon intensity rating to exceed a predetermined level. Shipowners would be entitled to claim any losses or costs resulting from a breach of this agreement.\nDespite some shipowners managing to secure agreement to this clause from customers, controlling a ship’s carbon intensity when it is operated by a trader remains challenging.\nLawyers report a growing number of shipowners and charterers seeking advice on the new grading system.\nShipowners and traders are still far from reaching a compromise, and concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of the rating system in reducing emissions and helping the IMO achieve its climate targets. Critics argue that the system lacks strong enforcement measures against vessels with low grades and potential loopholes in the rating calculations.\n\nClimate Capital\n\nExplore the FT’s coverage of the intersection between climate change, business, markets, and politics here.\nFind out more about our science-based sustainability commitments here.\n\nReference\nDenial of responsibility!

      "articleText": "I'm sure that by now, you've seen those social media posts claiming that \"the sixteen largest ships emit the same amount of CO2 as all the world's cars\" or \"a seagoing container vessel is just as polluting as up to 50 million cars.\" It's not entirely fake news, as there is some truth in specific contexts. But make no mistake: ICE road vehicles remain the main culprit for the transportation sector's colossal pollution.\n\nJust to put things in perspective, cars are responsible for 39% of transportation sector GHG emissions, while medium and heavy trucks along with buses and light commercial vehicles account for 35%. By comparison, ships' share is only 11%.\nFirst thing first: the origin of claims and their misinterpretation\nIn 2009, the American Geophysical Union, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the University of Colorado released the study \"Particulate emissions from commercial shipping: Chemical, physical, and optical properties.\" The study is based on research conducted in 2006 when scientists analyzed the exhaust from over 200 commercial vessels.\nTheir findings were worrisome, as researchers estimated that worldwide, ships emit yearly about 2.2 million pounds / 1 million tons of particulate pollution, including CO2 (the carbon dioxide driving global warming), NOx (the nitrogen oxides that sparked \"Dieselgate\"), SO2 (Sulfur dioxide), CO (Carbon monoxide), H2CO (Formaldehyde), and C2H4 (Ethylene), to name the most important ones.\nSome researchers involved in this study made statements that became incendiary in mass media and social media. One of them is \"Globally, shipping is thought to contribute almost as much primary PM as road traffic,\" where PM comes from \"particulate matter,\" just like in the case of cars' internal combustion engines. This led the lead researcher, Daniel Lack, to state in an interview, \"These ships are emitting as much [pollution] as 300m cars.\"\nOne of the study co-authors, James Corbett, who linked shipping particulate pollution to premature deaths among coastal populations, concluded that, hypothetically, 15 of the largest container ships could produce as much sulfur pollution as all the world's 760 million cars (at that time) if ships would use the dirtiest bunker fuel, while cars the cleanest fuel available. It was only a thought experiment, but little did he know what it would spark.\nOf course, nobody can actually measure the quantity of polluting particles emitted by all the vessels, cars, and road vehicles in the world. These values are estimated based on complex mathematical models only some scientists comprehend. Therefore, you and I and 99.99% of people cannot verify if their findings are valid. Most of us tend to trust science, but we also tend to read between the lines and omit the details. Where the devil hides, as they say. The\" WOW\" factor and the pressure to decarbonize the maritime sector You can only imagine how the masses received those messages. Details like \"hypothesis\" or \"sulfur pollution\" became unnecessary because online headlines, Facebook posts, and Instagram memes must be as short as possible to get your attention. Luckily for fossil fuels proponents, slightly perverting those scientists' claims successfully distracted people's attention from cars' ICE accusations.\nThe \"one tanker is polluting as much as 50 million cars\" became petrolheads' favorite argument when counteracting electroheads. Especially since it came from scientists, as many pointed out, missing the fact that it became fake news because of misinterpretation. The funny thing is that the same people who refuted global warming scientific facts were now sold to the scientists who involuntarily made ICE cars look much less guilty for pollution… Photo: Image by frimufilms on Freepik\n\nSome ten years later, experts from Danish ONG CE Delft quickly debunked the misinformation. They concluded that CO2 emissions from the global car fleet were two to four times higher than those of the maritime fleet. This aligns with data suggesting that the maritime sector was responsible for around 3% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions then.\nIn return, because a ship's engine emitted more NOx than a vehicle's engine per unit of fuel, the NOx emissions of the maritime fleet were most likely higher than those of the global car fleet. This is natural because the bunker fuel used by vessels was much more polluting than the high-grade diesel used in cars and trucks. It's also true that diesel rose until \"Dieselgate\" in 2015, especially in Europe.\nRegarding the SOx emissions, because the limit for road-vehicle fuels was several thousand times (!) lower than shipping fuel, CE Delft concluded that, indeed, the maritime fleet emits far more SOx than the global fleet and also that the sixteen largest container vessels (using the dirtiest bunker fuel) have similar SOx emissions to 50 million cars.\nI don't know if this whole mess was slowing down EV adoption. But it definitely put real pressure on the maritime industry, which at that moment had almost no objective emissions standards. It all came down to the bunker fuel the vast majority of nearly 100,000 vessels in the world were using then. This is one of the dirtiest fuels, as it's merely a viscous residue after refining gasoline, diesel, and other petroleum products.\nIn 2013, the International Maritime Organization enacted mandatory measures for the maritime sector to improve propulsion technology efficiency and reduce GHG emissions. Many reports concluded that the climate impact of this industry was too much overlooked. What is the best description of shipping? If global shipping were a country, it would be the sixth largest producer of greenhouse gas emissions.\nKeeping the business-as-always paradigm in this sector could lead to a 120% increase in GHG emissions by 2050, which is unacceptable. The latest report IMO GHG Study 2020 concluded that the rapid rise in maritime transport demand led to a 9.6% increase in emissions from 2012 to 2018, with an estimated 1,076 million tonnes. This is even though the carbon intensity was almost 30% better in 2018 than in 2012. So, what are we going to do? First of all, the dirty bunker fuel must go away for good, as the lifespan of a cargo vessel is around 20 years. Consider that such a vessel operates 24 hours a day for an average of 280 days a year. The largest ship diesel engine, with an output of more than 85,000 kW, can generate more than 5,000 tonnes of SOx emissions yearly. You do the math for a twenty-year interval.\nThe industry is investing heavily in converting ships' diesel engines to use LNG (liquefied natural gas) because sulfur is reduced by 90%. But the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) experts warn that CO2-equivalent emissions reduction is only 10% over the entire lifecycle of ships. IMO expects that naval flows will most likely double until 2050, so the LNG is not valid, primarily since methane leakage related to natural gas extraction is already a big concern.\nThat's why the World Bank and the United Nations pressure governments and financial entities to develop regulations and heavily incentivize low-carbon fuels, like biofuels, green hydrogen, renewables, and synthetic fuels (e-fuels). But, as we've seen in other articles, developing feasible technical solutions for vessels and the infrastructure needed is too slow. Photo: IDTechEx\n\nThis is where research company IDTechEx's claim seems perfectly justified: \"The future of the electric ship industry lies with hybrid cargo vessels.\" Today, less than 1% of the global maritime fleet uses alternative fuels, battery propulsion included. Battery systems improve the efficiency of current engine technology the most, so hybridization is the most cost-effective solution in the short and medium term.\nThe problem is that 90% of global goods transport is over the sea because maritime transport has the best ton/kilometer cost ratio today. Half the more than 100,000 vessels fleet consists of container ships and big tankers, responsible for more than three-quarters of this sector's emissions. Converting them to hybrids will take a long time, and the costs will be very high due to the scarcity of critical raw materials and the fierce competition with other transport branches and the energy sector for lithium-ion batteries.\nThis is why alternative solutions, such as wind-assisted propulsion technologies, are gaining momentum. WindWings from BAR Technologies consists of large wing sails measuring up to 37.5 meters / 123 feet in height. They are said to help reduce fuel consumption by up to 30% - in the case of the first ship equipped with this device, it is expected that WindWings will save 1.5 tonnes of fuel on an average global route.\nThe eSAIL system from bound4blue or the Norsepower Rotor Sail uses the Magnus effect, which harnesses the wind to generate thrust for the ship. Theoretically, they provide up to 40% fuel consumption and emissions reduction. Besides, a wide range of tankers and heavy carriers with at least ten years of service remaining can be conveniently retrofitted to these technologies.\nThe good news is that the maritime industry is well aware of its responsibility to slash emissions, and the most significant players are already investing big money in low-carbon technologies. The bad news is that most experts in this field believe the industry will not be able to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.\nAt least, road transport can be entirely electrified by then if we stop finding excuses. Three-quarters of GHG emissions come from passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, medium and heavy trucks, buses, and two- and three-wheelers. Shipping's share is just 11-12%, so I can live with it not becoming entirely zero-emissions because at least its pollution is hundreds of miles away from our cities.",

      "articleText": "The maritime sector is experiencing a remarkable shift with the emergence of hybrid ships as one solution to achieving net zero in shipping. In a paper, marine technology specialist Wärtsilä examines the latest trends shaping the course of hybrid ship propulsion. From the introduction of novel battery chemistries and the surge in battery power capacity to the promising potential of fuel cells and the evolution of electrical integration concepts, hybrid technology is transforming, driven by sustainability and optimised performance.\nTraditionally, marine batteries have relied on lithium-ion technology, much like those used in the automotive and energy sectors. However, Wärtsilä identifies a significant shift in this area. Alongside prevalent nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries, new lithium-ion battery chemistries are making their way into the marine realm. Notable introductions include lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) batteries and lithium-titanium-oxide (LTO) batteries.\nThese emerging battery types offer distinct advantages tailored to specific applications. Longer lifespan, reduced weight, and lower costs are some of the benefits associated with these new chemistries.\nFurther, the transition from conventional power sources to hybrid solutions has been catalysed by advancements in battery power.\nThese robust energy storage systems facilitate flexibility in energy-intensive tasks and pave the way for innovative operational profiles.\nBattery considerations\nWärtsilä continued that contrary to misconceptions, the motivation behind the pursuit of more powerful batteries is not cost-driven. While battery prices witnessed a steady decline prior to 2020, this trajectory has been altered due to escalating global demand for battery cells and raw materials. Wärtsilä emphasised that substantial battery sizes offer operational versatility, potentially leading to significant fuel savings. The hybrid Misje Vita bulk carrier, for instance, demonstrated up to 40% fuel savings compared with its counterparts through the integration of advanced battery technology.\nWärtsilä also underscored the significance of functional considerations in determining the ideal battery size for a vessel. A ship’s operational profile and intended functions should dictate battery design, enabling efficient propulsion systems. This paradigm shift emphasises the importance of redesigning propulsion systems based on functional requirements, rather than simply adding weight through battery integration.\nWärtsilä urged ship owners to engage experts in cases where existing propulsion designs are not aligned with the potential benefits of hybrid systems, advocating for a holistic re-evaluation of vessel design.\nFuel cells, meanwhile, are emerging as a pivotal technology in the maritime sector, working akin to self-sustaining batteries that generate electricity and heat through continuous fuel and oxidising agent consumption. While batteries excel in handling variable loads, fuel cells shine in stable base load scenarios. Presently, proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are available for marine applications. These demonstrate over 50% efficiency when hydrogen is directly employed.\nThe future also holds promise for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), which can generate electricity directly from methanol or ammonia, although this technology remains under development. Wärtsilä highlights that PEMFCs stand as a viable option for hydrogen-driven propulsion, albeit with considerations for space requirements and reduced vessel range due to hydrogen storage.\nCurrent questions\nThe rise of direct current (DC) hubs in powertrain integration is another notable trend outlined by Wärtsilä. Hybrid ships traditionally house engines producing alternating current (AC) alongside DC battery systems. The emergence of DC hubs is reshaping electricity distribution, potentially eliminating the need for AC-to-DC transformations.\nHowever, Wärtsilä said that while DC hubs hold promise for smaller high-speed engine vessels, they might not be optimal for larger or high-powered hybrid vessels. The paper underscores the importance of assessing vessel specifications and operational requirements before adopting DC hub integration.\nShore power, an essential component of hybrid ships, has experienced its own standardisation shift. The IEC 80005 standard for high-voltage shore connection (HVSC) systems, established in 2011, has been pivotal in this transformation. HVSC systems not only eliminate the need for auxiliary gensets while in port but also serve as a means to charge hybrid vessel batteries.\nWärtsilä pointed out that major hybrid vessels in production, such as ro-pax, ro-ro, and pure car and truck carriers, are now equipped with IEC 80005 shore power connections.\nThe paper points out that as standardisation progresses, the efficiency and speed of charging processes will continue to improve, with potential benefits extending to reduced downtime and enhanced operational readiness.\nCollectively, these trends reflect the maritime industry’s concerted efforts to navigate toward sustainable, efficient, and innovative solutions as hybrid ships become an increasingly integral part of the maritime ecosystem.\nSource: Baltic Exchange",

      "articleText": "Sustainability pioneer, Value Group (Value Maritime and Value Carbon) is pleased to announce that Shell Ventures has joined Value Group’s investor base to accelerate and expand Value Group’s carbon capture utilisation and storage strategy.\nValue Maritime is the pioneering developer and installer of one of the first commercially viable hybrid CO2 capture and exhaust gas cleaning systems (Filtree), which shipowners and operators can lease to help them lower their emissions.\nShell Ventures, the corporate venture capital arm of Shell, supports companies in their early, scale and growth phases, providing investments that stimulate the development of new technologies and disruptive business models to lower emissions and accelerate the energy transition.\nComprehensive carbon care\nSince 2017, Value Maritime has supported multiple shipowners and operators in reducing their emissions with its Filtree System. This unique system cleans sulphur, ultra-fine particulate matter and CO2 from ships’ exhaust emissions as well as oil residue and particulate matter from the vessels’ washing water. As a result, the Filtree System supports both the lowering of CO2 emissions and a reduction of acidification of seawater.\nThe Filtree System also features an integrated carbon capture feature that allows ships to store the CO2 they collect onboard in dedicated fixed tanks or non-fixed battery containers. These onboard storage facilities are filled with CO2, which can then be sustainably offloaded in port for re-use or storage elsewhere.\nBuilding on this effective business model, Value Maritime earlier this year announced the launch of sister company, Value Carbon. With this, the Value Group expanded its role with a focus on the entire process, from carbon capture to landside utilisation and/or storage.\nGlobal boost for emissions reduction\nWith Shell Ventures’ support, Value Group aims to accelerate its strategy throughout the maritime value chain, including the expansion of CO2 offtake and monetisation of opportunities globally. Both parties believe strong partnerships between companies, governments, customers, and industries are needed to unlock the potential of CCUS to reduce emissions in the maritime industry.\nValue Group Co-Founder and Director Maarten Lodewijks says, “We are very excited with this new development. Shell Ventures will support us in many ways that will help our strategy moving forward and contribute to our development. The participation of Shell Ventures serves as confirmation that we are on the right path and is a huge compliment for our team.\nWe are dedicated to decarbonising shipping across the value chain from sustainable technology, equipment, installation and capturing with our Filtree and Carbon Capture system to reliable offtake and certification. This is an important milestone for our company and we look forward to building on it. Together with our key shareholders like Shell, our partners and clients and in cooperation with governmental and institutional bodies, we can significantly speed up the decarbonisation process.”\nShell Ventures’ Chief Investment Officer Robert Linck says “This investment aligns with Shell’s aim to support the development of solutions that can help industries decarbonize, as part of our focus on delivering more value with less emissions. Shipping is a notoriously hard-to-abate sector where volumes have doubled over the last couple of decades and the upward trend is expected to continue. Value Group’s promising solution is one of the first on the market that provides the maritime industry with a viable solution for carbon capture today. We are proud to be joining their journey and look forward to supporting them as they expand their activities with shipowners and operators across the globe to lower emissions.”\nThe Value Group brings together two pioneering sister companies. Leveraging the experience of Value Maritime and the expertise of Value Carbon they are on a journey towards decarbonising shipping and industry.\nAt the forefront, Value Maritime’s technology has been helping shipowners and operators to increase their competitiveness by achieving valuable emission reductions and noteworthy financial savings since 2017. Their vision is to dramatically decrease the environmental footprint of shipping and significantly contribute to improving the overall sustainability of the maritime industry.\nIn parallel, Value Carbon is innovating land-based carbon management, spanning the entire carbon value chain from carbon offtake, handling, resourceful re-use and efficient storage all underpinned with a green and financial dividend.\nValue Group – Elevating value and uplifting the environment with an innovative enterprise that is sustainable by nature and with a team that is dedicated to making an impact.\nSource: Value Group",

      "articleText": "A new analysis from the Global Maritime Forum has found that the cost gap between operating ships on zero-emission ammonia and conventional fuel could be closed before 2030 and possibly as early as 2026.\nAmmonia is increasingly seen as an important solution for decarbonising the shipping sector, given its high scalability and potential for use on long-distance shipping routes. For the time being, however, ammonia-powered gas carriers are seen as significantly more expensive to own and operate than conventional gas carriers.\nAs part of the Nordic Green Ammonia Powered Ships (NoGAPS) project, co-funded by Nordic Innovation, a new study from the Global Maritime Forum explores options for addressing those cost concerns. The analysis looked at the pathways for commercialising early ammonia-powered vessels like M/S NoGAPS – an ammonia-powered gas carrier designed to operate between the US Gulf and Northwestern Europe that has been awarded Approval in Principle1 from the maritime classification society DNV. It found several measures that could significantly reduce the current cost delta between ammonia and conventional fuel and reduce commercial risks for M/S NoGAPS and similar projects.\n‘’Since 2020, the NoGAPS project has brought together key industry leaders to progress an ammonia-powered gas tanker concept towards real-world implementation. With the completion of this latest project phase, we not only have a detailed ship design that could be used for a shipyard tender but also a feasible commercialisation pathways. We hope this boosts confidence amongst charter parties and investors to take steps towards the realisation of M/S NoGAPS and other ammonia-powered vessels,” says Jesse Fahnestock, Project Director, Global Maritime Forum.\nNumerous cost reduction pathways identified\nReducing the elevated costs and related commercial risks of early ammonia-powered vessels is currently the primary barrier to finding suitable and competitive finance for projects like M/S NoGAPS. The new analysis identifies several methods for responding to this challenge. These include dual-fuel vessel design (i.e., the ability for a vessel to run on conventional fuels as well as ammonia), competitive debt financing arrangements, operational efficiencies, fuel subsidies, and governmental regulation. The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the EU’s Fit for 55 Package, for example, would reduce the cost of owning and operating M/S NoGAPS by 20% and 10%, respectively.\nThe most effective way to reduce the cost gap between ammonia and conventional fuel is to pull on numerous cost-reduction levers simultaneously. For example, in a scenario in which M/S NoGAPS runs on a route between the US Gulf and Northwestern Europe, exclusively bunkers US ammonia, applies Fit for 55 measures and IRA subsidies, and maximises operational efficiencies, the cost gap could be closed as early as 2026 and the vessel could also approach cost parity by 2030.\nAbout the NoGAPS project\nThe NoGAPS project brings together leading players from the Nordic shipping and energy value chain: Yara Clean Ammonia, BW Epic Kosan, MAN Energy Solutions, Wärtsilä, DNV, Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping, and the Global Maritime Forum as leading partners; with support from Danish Maritime Authority as the flag representative and Breeze Ship Design as the ship designer.\n“We are delighted to see the successful completion of the NoGAPS project. The ship design and outline of commercialisation options are important milestones that we believe could contribute to accelerating the acceptance of clean ammonia as a zero-emission fuel. Yara Clean Ammonia’s collaboration with NoGAPS is yet another example of our commitment to developing clean ammonia as credible zero-emission shipping fuel,” says Murali Srinivasan, Senior Vice President, Commercial, Yara Clean Ammonia.\n“We have been a strong supporter of the NoGAPS project since it began in 2020. For BW Epic Kosan, with a fleet of over 60 vessels, participating in the NoGAPS project has given us greater business and technical insights into the safe management of ammonia, especially during transition. By understanding how to manage ammonia propulsion and how commercial viability can be achieved, BW Epic Kosan is well-positioned to manage new forms of alternative propulsion as we move to a lower-carbon world,” says Thomas Wøidemann, BW Epic Kosan Commercial Director.\n“The NoGAPS project has from day one set out to explore the commercial and technical opportunities of introducing early mover low emission shipping services. Bringing together leading industry players to innovate and qualify technical, safety and commercial viability for asset deployment has proven its strength and ability to develop solutions for the new future of shipping,” says Claus Graugaard, CTO, Onboard Vessel Solutions, Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping.\nFor questions or further information, please reach out to the Global Maritime Forum’s Head of Communications, Rasmus Nord Jørgensen, at [email protected]\nThe Global Maritime Forum is an international not-for-profit organisation working to create a decarbonised maritime industry that supports sustainable long-term economic development while being committed to human welfare and dignity.

      "articleText": "An integrated solution that enables ship operators both to manage emissions liabilities and trade carbon allowances under the impending EU ETS regime for shipping has been launched by maritime data firm OceanScore.\n“The industry faces a major challenge to navigate the complexity of the new regulation and mitigate financial risk due to the requirement to purchase carbon credits to cover the cost of emissions, which will reach €8 billion or more annually,” OceanScore’s co-Managing Director Albrecht Grell said.\n“The interplay between owners, managers and charterers creates significant complexities unique to shipping and poses potentially significant risks, especially for ship managers, if not managed properly. Excel alone will not be sufficient to maintain transparency and control of these processes.”\nOceanScore and RWE team up to mitigate emissions risk with EU ETS management solution for shipping\nThe Hamburg-based firm has therefore developed the web-based ETS Manager to manage and monitor the entire process from automatically ingesting vessel operational data, assessing the need for EU Allowances (EUAs), allocating them to owners or stakeholders, requesting and accounting for them, and tracking open positions. It incorporates the advanced trading tool EUA Trader, powered by RWE Supply & Trading, to buy and sell EUAs.\nOceanScore’s EUA Trader is also available as a standalone application. Furthermore, for those clients that wish to outsource management of their EUA accounts to their respective registries, OceanScore can support this by monitoring account movements through various APIs in ETS Manager.\nAutomating process of compliance\nGrell said the comprehensive solution, with a high level of automation to reduce administrative workload and possible issues with wrong data entries, is geared to “simplifying complexity” for shipping companies.\nETS Manager is rapidly gaining traction among both European and non-European customers ahead of the phased implementation of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) for the maritime sector from 1 January 2024, with OceanScore investor Döhle Group among several pilot customers, he added.\nShipping companies, as the designated Document of Compliance holder (DoC holder) under the EU ETS regime, will be required to surrender to the authorities EUAs based on their annual emissions, starting at 40% of emissions in 2024 and rising to 70% and 100% of emissions in 2025 and 2026, respectively, under the three-year phase-in of the scheme.\nThis will necessitate having administrative systems in place to track emissions and determine the volume of EUAs required, as well as to assign the costs of these to the owner or charterer based on the ‘polluter pays’ principle to avoid unnecessary financial exposure for the DoC holder, typically a ship manager.\nMonitoring EUA liabilities\nOceanScore’s co-Managing Director Ralf Garrn explained the regulation poses issues such as how to accurately monitor emissions, how to acquire and trade EUAs, which trading platform to use, how to achieve the best price, how many EUAs should be purchased and who should pay for carbon credits.\n“With the clock ticking to implementation of the EU ETS, shipping companies need to understand the practical implications and initiate efficient systems to address these issues and ensure compliance. A solid monitoring solution, properly covering the many different options to deal with the ETS regime, is a necessity given the complexities of shipping and the ETS regulation,” he said.\nGarrn explained ETS Manager is undergirded by a network of third-party collaborations to support a smooth end-to-end process for emissions management, from securing good quality data at the outset to ensuring trustworthy EUA trading at the other end.\nBy collaborating with verifiers and data quality service providers like DNV’s Emissions Connect, Seacotec, Swiss Climate and Verifavia, OceanScore ensures for joint customers that data in the ETS Manager corresponds to the final, verified annual data that are the basis for surrendering EUAs to the respective authorities, as well as allowing for a seamless, API-based data flow.\nReliable trading platform\nEUA Trader tracks the market price of EUAs and facilitates buying and selling of carbon credits on the RWE Supply & Trading platform through a simple, all online operation, with the ability to buy incremental volumes as needed and forward trading flexibility to hedge the risk of price changes.\nEUA purchases can be made for individual or multiple ships and these transactions can be allocated to specific stakeholders in the value chain, thereby eliminating the need to conduct inter-company trades and avoiding unnecessary price/cost disputes.\nGrell emphasised the importance of selecting a reliable trading platform with transparency on pricing to achieve the most economic EUA transactions and thereby minimise the cost of emissions.\n“RWE Supply & Trading has a strong international reputation with high credibility and a proven track record in EUA trading, making them the ideal partner for our market-leading ETS solution for shipping,” he said.\n“The feedback we are getting from the market is that the flexibility of the trading platform we offer, as well as the full integration of this trading platform into our ETS management solution, offer unique benefits to the shipping community. Our extremely competitive prices serve as an additional argument.”\nSource: OceanScore",

      "articleText": "Reducing the methane slip is a vital challenge in taking LNG-fueled ships towards zero greenhouse gas emissions. Now the Finnish marine technology supplier Wärtsilä and Swedish shipping company Furetank are co-developing and testing two technologies showing the potential to halve the methane slip.\nRunning vessels on LNG/LBG brings many benefits compared to conventional fuel oil, reducing emissions of CO2, NOx, SOx and harmful particles. But a much debated downside is the methane slip: the release of unburned gas fuel, not fully combusted in the engines.\nWärtsilä W34DF main engine\nAlthough the combustion rate is generally high and the methane slip accounts for a very small fraction of the fuel used, methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. Thus, this slip is the most critical technical challenge to overcome in gas-fueled vessels; a challenge which Wärtsilä and Furetank are now countering.\nTwo innovative technologies\nTwo technical solutions have been tested in Furetank’s Vinga series tankers. One of them is a Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reduction package, developed by Wärtsilä for dual fuel engines. The GHG package actively controls the engine while working in demanding conditions like manoeuvring, harsh sea conditions or varying fuel quality. This way, combustion is optimized and unburned gas emissions minimized.\nFure vinga\nThe other solution is the Low Load Optimization package, reducing the methane slip at low engine loads, for example during harbour operations like loading and unloading. This package actively balances the loading of each engine cylinder, optimizing the overall total engine efficiency even at a low engine load.\nReduction reaching 50 per cent\nThe tests performed, both in the laboratory and at sea, show very promising results. The methane slip was reduced by 45-50%.\n– These are great results, far exceeding what we had expected or technically believed. The tests show a significant impact in absolute terms. We believe many shipping companies will be interested in these solutions. And this is not the end of the road, there is more to be done, says Göran Österdahl, sales director of marine power at Wärtsilä.\nVinga series main engine\n”A tough nut to crack”\nFor Furetank, this is yet another step in progressing the emission-reducing technology in the Vinga vessel series, designed by Furetank with partners and the globally most energy efficient ships in their segment according to the IMO EEDI index.\nVinga series main engine\n– We had many discussions with Wärtsilä during the past years on how to counter the methane slip. It is a tough nut to crack and the most important technical issue for us to solve. There is an ongoing chase for new engine solutions which will only intensify with the EU ETS system and stricter IMO regulations. We are happy to have this fast track to developers and manufacturers of advanced engine technology, says Clas Gustafsson, Technical Manager at Furetank.\nLBG/LNG fuel tank\nCritical time for future fuels\nThe functionality will be implemented in the Vinga sister vessels currently being built at the China Merchants Jinling Shipyard in Yangzhou, and retrofitted into all earlier ships in the series.\nLNG/LBG tank on board Vinga vessel\n– This is a very successful collaboration, as Furetank has asked us for solutions and offered to perform tests in real-life conditions. We are in a phase of intense research and development on future fuels, making it invaluable for us to find test-willing partners. Our entire industry will need to establish many operator/product developer collaborations. Otherwise progress will be too slow, says Göran Österdahl.\nSource: Furetank",

The studies have already been conducted on a range of vessel types including ro-ro and ro-pax vessels, a drill ship, a container vessel and a gas carrier.\nThe process takes four to six months of study and design work. Wärtsilä Exhaust Treatment’s experts are involved in ship design at an early stage to conduct engineering work to understand how CCS can be smoothly integrated once the technology is launched to market.\nWärtsilä is conducting the feasibility studies across both newbuild and existing vessels. Retrofit CCS installations will be significantly smoothed by the presence of a scrubber onboard. Wärtsilä Exhaust Treatment is already offering CCS-Ready scrubbers to the market, which are integrated onboard in a way that enables a CCS system to be added easily in the future once the technology is commercialised.\nWärtsilä Exhaust Treatment’s engineers examine CCS performance in the company’s test hall in Moss, Norway. © Wärtsilä\nOnce completed, the CCS feasibility study work enables Wärtsilä to provide customers with a fully rounded commercial offer that can be shared with shipyards to get an exact quote for installation. During the feasibility studies, Wärtsilä’s experts closely examine the existing naval architecture of the ship and work to understand how the power, space and exhaust demands of CCS can be accommodated onboard. Owners will receive a qualified analysis of the costs of CCS integration, and a clear list of considerations on how a potential retrofit would be conducted in the least intrusive way.\nConducting the studies today enables Wärtsilä to bring forward the early stages of CCS integration and, in doing so, lower the barrier to entry once the technology is commercialised in the near future. The studies also serve to educate customers on the upsides and particular considerations associated with installing CCS onboard their vessels. Finally, as the studies will run in parallel with the implementation of new environmental regulations for shipping, owners who conduct them today will be ‘ahead of the curve’ versus their peers.\nWärtsilä Exhaust Treatment’s engineers examine CCS performance in the company’s test hall in Moss, Norway. © Wärtsilä\nSigurd Jenssen, Director, Wärtsilä Exhaust Treatment, said: “Launching these feasibility studies and being able to offer them to market is the exciting latest step in our process of bringing carbon capture and storage to market in shipping. It builds on the market-leading work we are conducting in our test hall in Moss, where our technology is already demonstrating our targeted 70% capture rate, and enables us to directly engage with customers to smooth the CCS adoption process in the near future.”\nJenssen continued: “By conducting these studies today, we are already building a considerable track record and understanding of how this technology will work across multiple vessel types. It builds on the considerable uptake we have already seen for our CCS-Ready scrubbers, which show that the industry is not only exploring CCS as a speculative technology, but is actively investing in its foundations as a decarbonisation solution. We look forward to conducting more of these studies in the coming months as we work to bring our CCS system to market.”\nWhen a customer opts for a Wärtsilä CCS-Ready scrubber, the company takes measures during the scrubber installation process to ensure adequate space for the future installation of CCS system.

      "articleText": "in International Shipping News,Shipping: Emission Possible\n30/08/2023\n\nERMA FIRST, a leading sustainable maritime solutions provider, has received a letter of professional opinion from DNV categorising ERMA FIRST BLUE CONNECT as an energy-saving device and verifying its positive impact on Carbon Intensity Indicator performance.\nFollowing a thorough review, DNV has issued a letter of professional opinion confirming that ERMA FIRST’s alternative maritime power (AMP) system, BLUE CONNECT, meets the requirements for categorisation as an ‘energy-saving device’ (ESD). In the same document, DNV recognises BLUE CONNECT’s ability to improve vessel Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) ratings in line with regulations set out by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).\nDimitris Tsoulos, BLUE CONNECT Director, ERMA FIRST, said: “BLUE CONNECT’s official recognition as an energy-saving device that can help ship owners to improve their CII rating is a significant milestone for the product and for ERMA FIRST as an organisation. This letter of professional opinion from DNV provides evidence of the benefits BLUE CONNECT can deliver as we strive to offer solutions that facilitate regulatory compliance and support the decarbonisation of shipping and the protection of coastal environments.”\nDimitris Tsoulos, BLUE CONNECT Director, ERMA FIRST\nBy plugging into an onshore power supply and shutting down its diesel auxiliary engines while berthed, a vessel equipped with BLUE CONNECT not only saves energy but eliminates the emission of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide in port, thereby reducing its overall carbon intensity per transport work, Tsoulos explained. In addition to improving CII ratings in accordance with IMO requirements, the solution allows ship operators to comply with port regulations as authorities worldwide continue to develop and implement requirements for the use of shore power at berth.\nAs the leading global manufacturer of ballast water treatment systems (BWTS), ERMA FIRST considers the protection of marine ecosystems as its primary objective. In developing BLUE CONNECT, the company drew on the experience gained through its industry-leading ERMA FIRST FIT BWTS, to create a product that goes far beyond regulatory compliance in terms of environmental benefits. Specifically, BLUE CONNECT helps improve air quality and reduce noise and vibrations in ports, enhancing health and quality of life in surrounding communities while minimising impacts on aquatic fauna.\nThe solution is suitable for retrofit and newbuild installations and is available in containerised or stand-alone formats. Standard models currently cater to Ro-Ro, Ro-Pax and pure-passenger ferries as well as container ships, cruise ships and tankers, but the system can be tailored to the needs of other vessel types.\nSource: ERMA First",

      "articleText": "in International Shipping News,Shipping: Emission Possible\n29/08/2023\n\nAET, one of the leading owners and operators of maritime transportation assets and specialised services, has delivered its newest vessel, a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) powered by dual-fuel liquefied natural gas (LNG) engines, on long-term charter to Shell Tankers (Singapore) Private Limited. It is the first of three, state-of-the-art crude tankers to be delivered by AET, based on an agreement signed in March 2021.\nThe Malaysian-flagged Eagle Vellore was named at a ceremony at the MMHE Pasir Gudang yard, attended by the Deputy Minister of Transport, Malaysia and other Malaysian government officials. The naming of the 300,000 dwt tanker in Malaysia marks an important milestone for AET and its parent MISC.\nMaking the announcement, Zahid Osman, President & CEO of AET said:\n“Today’s naming of Eagle Vellore marks another significant milestone in strengthening our position as a sustainable shipping organisation. Adding another LNG dual-fuel VLCC to our fleet and our ongoing development of zero-emission vessels is consistent with our commitment to deliver more energy with less emissions, supporting customer demand and the world’s need for energy security.\nI would like to thank Shell for their continued trust and confidence in us, building on our longterm collaboration, as we both look to further expand as leaders in shipping’s energy transition.\nMy appreciation also goes out to Lloyd’s Register, ship builder Hanwha Ocean and colleagues from Eaglestar, MHB and my team members in AET for their respective roles in the safe construction, delivery and today’s naming of the vessel.”\nStacie Pitt, Senior Vice President for Crude Trading at Shell, said:\n“The delivery of the Eagle Vellore is an important addition to Shell’s fleet of crude tankers. Fleet composition is an essential lever to tackle the decarbonisation challenge, requiring increased investment in dual-fuel capable vessels and efficiency measures. LNG benefits from mature technology and a growing bunkering network which have helped cement its position as the leading alternative fuel today, with bio and synthetic LNG offering a long-term pathway to decarbonisation. “While we continue to invest in LNG, with over half of Shell’s crude tanker fleet set to be dualfuel LNG by the end of the year, we are also developing zero-emissions fuel options to support future decarbonisation of the shipping sector. Continued collaboration is integral to shipping’s energy transition.”\nCapt. Rajalingam Subramaniam, AET Chairman and MISC President & Group CEO said:\n“Congratulations AET on the successful delivery and naming of Eagle Vellore. The event today proudly signifies two pivotal milestones – celebrating the arrival of the second Malaysian-flagged eco-efficient LNG dual-fuel VLCC and marking the inaugural naming ceremony for such a vessel in Malaysia. This achievement showcases the MISC Group’s firm dedication to supporting Malaysia’s maritime journey and global leadership in sustainable solutions. It aligns with the Group’s purposeful transition towards a sustainable future as we accelerate our efforts to meet the 2030 and 2050 GHG reduction goals.\nOur heartfelt congratulations to our team members in AET, Eaglestar and everyone in the MISC Group for their remarkable collaboration which is instrumental in delivering this asset with an impeccable safety record of zero Lost Time Injury (LTI). Furthermore, we express our appreciation to Shell as the charterer, for their unwavering trust and continued partnership for a common sustainability agenda. Our appreciation too, to the Ministry of Transport Malaysia for their support in advancing the Malaysian maritime sector. Lastly, to the dedicated marine professionals of Eagle Vellore, congratulations, and stay safe always.” Eagle Vellore’s two sister vessels are currently under construction by Hanwha Ocean (formerly Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering) in Geoje, South Korea and due to be delivered later this year on long-term charter to Shell Tankers (Singapore) Private Limited. Both AET and Eaglestar site teams have been working closely together with the yard to ensure the safe delivery. Eaglestar is also the appointed ship manager of Eagle Vellore and its two sister vessels. Classed by Lloyd’s Register, the three ships are designed with state-of-the-art technologies, optimised hull forms and propellers, wake improvement ducts and rudder bulbs to further improve vessel’s energy efficiency. Being among the most eco-friendly VLCCs available today, they comply with IMO’s 2025 EEDI Phase III and with a 99% reduction in sulphur oxides, 85% reduction in nitrogen oxides and 95% particulate matter.\nSource: AET",

The green methanol will be bunkered in Rotterdam.\nThe biomethanol is produced from biogas from manure. The biogas is upgraded to biomethane and injected into the existing gas grid and the methanol is produced from the biomethane in the grid on a mass-balance basis. The existing European biogas certificate system is used to trace the attributes of the biomethane to the biomethanol and safeguard against double-claims. This way, green methanol can be produced in existing facilities using existing infrastructure and plants enabling a quick route to market. The method can contribute to a greener gas grid while capturing harmful methane emissions that would arise from the manure feedstock if left untouched. The biomethanol is ISCC EU certified in accordance with the EU Renewable Energy Directive.\n\nMaersk defines ’green fuels’ as fuels with low to very low GHG emissions over their life cycle compared to fossil fuels. Different green fuels achieve different life cycle reductions depending on their production pathway. By ‘low’ we refer to fuels with 65-80% life cycle GHG reductions compared to fossil fuels. ‘Very low’ refers to fuels with 80-95% life cycle GHG reductions compared to fossil fuels.\nLong term, the feeder vessel will be fueled by e-methanol from a plant in Southern Denmark, operated by European Energy, which is expected to come on-stream in the first half of 2024.\nMaersk has an ambitious 2040 target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions and aims to transport a minimum of 25% of Ocean cargo using green fuels by 2030. The 2,100 TEU (twenty-foot-equivalent) feeder vessel is an important step toward the long-term objective of gradually renewing the entire Maersk fleet to operate solely on green fuels. Maersk has 24 additional methanol vessels on order for delivery between 2024 and 2027 and has a policy to only order new, owned vessels that comes with a green fuel option.\nSource: Maersk",

      "articleText": "in International Shipping News,Shipping: Emission Possible\n08/09/2023\n\nFaced with tough competition for greener fuels from other sectors, new 2030 maritime emission targets hang in the balance. According to the latest edition of DNV‘s Maritime Forecast to 2050 the shipping industry will find it challenging to secure enough supply of carbon-neutral fuels. The report emphasizes the need to consider all alternative approaches to reducing emissions and to take action now to secure future success.\nIncreasing regulatory pressure to decarbonize, including stricter targets set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) this July, means the shipping industry now needs to achieve a 20% reduction in emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by or around 2050. To meet the anticipated demand of 17 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) annually by 2030, the maritime sector needs to access a staggering 30-40% of the projected worldwide carbon- neutral fuel supply. Shipowners must therefore focus beyond fuels, in particular on what can be done now to achieve energy efficiencies and carbon emission reductions.\nKnut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO DNV Maritime, said: “The 2020s marks the decisive decade for shipping. Securing greener fuel supply is critical. However, focusing on fuels alone can distract us from making an impact this decade and ambitious future declarations are not good enough. What we need is tangible actions that will reduce emissions. Energy efficiency measures can deliver decarbonization results now and towards 2030.”\nThe Maritime Forecast to 2050 presents an updated look on a range of regulations and drivers for the decarbonization of shipping, the most important being new IMO regulations, the inclusion of shipping in the European Union’s (EU) Emissions Trading Scheme and incoming well-to-wake requirements. These regulations will increase the operational cost of using carbon fuels, incentivising shipowners to put plans in place today to reduce their carbon output.\n“Our latest report outlines several energy efficiency measures that can deliver decarbonization results now. It emphasises the need for the maritime sector to adopt a holistic approach to ensure a strong evolution of regulations and technologies, as well as long-term security of fuel supply,” said Eirik Ovrum, Principal Consultant in DNV Maritime, and Lead Author of the Maritime Forecast.\nTo overcome decarbonization challenges, the sector can adopt operational energy efficiency measures such as air lubrication systems and wind assisted propulsion. The latter has already been installed on 28 large vessels, delivering fuel savings of between 5-9% to date. The potential when retrofitted on existing ships can reach 25%.\nIn addition, technologies such as onboard carbon capture and storage and nuclear propulsion can address the competition for sustainable biomass and renewable electricity. The report presents an economic analysis of both options through detailed case studies that can help stakeholders make informed decision around these technologies.\nOther findings include that a fuel technology transition is already underway, with half the ordered tonnage capable of using liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or methanol in dual-fuel engines, compared to one third of the tonnage on order last year. For ships in operation, 6.5% of tonnage can now operate on alternative fuels, compared to 5.5% last year. The uptake of methanol and LPG is also starting to show in the statistics together with the first hydrogen-fuelled newbuilds. There are currently several ongoing demonstration projects for ammonia-fuelled ships, and a growing pipeline of ammonia-fuelled ships soon to hit the order book.\nSource: DNV, https://www.dnv.com/news/shipping-in-decisive-decade-to-meet-tighter-emission-targets-246756\n\nTagged with: Tops",

      "articleText": "An independent study conducted by maritime research house Thetius has revealed that methanol to hydrogen generator technology, developed by renewable energy technology pioneer e1 Marine, can significantly reduce EPA-regulated emissions by up to 99% when using grey methanol when compared with conventional diesel engines for inland waterway vessels. The technology can also reduce GHG emissions by up to 85% when using green methanol as feedstock in the same application.\nThe international maritime industry is under pressure to meet 2030 and 2050 International Maritime Organization (IMO) emissions goals, as well as local and global emissions rules, including those set by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and European Union (EU).\ne1 Marine’s methanol to hydrogen generator technology makes it possible to convert methanol to fuel-cell grade hydrogen onboard a vessel. This provides a power source for hydrogen fuel cells and electric batteries, which can be used for primary propulsion.\n\nIn the report, ‘Towards Zero’, Thetius’ analysis used 50,000 hours of operating data from eight inland diesel pushboats (workboats) in the USA to develop a cumulative load profile for comparison, which was underpinned by science developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The results of the modeling showed significant potential emissions (EPA and GHG) reduction versus conventional diesel engines for vessel operators who deploy methanol to hydrogen fuel cell power solutions. The conclusions indicated were:\n\n‘Near Zero’ harmful emissions – achieving a 99% reduction of EPA-regulated emissions, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), hydrocarbons (HC), and carbon monoxide (CO) based on using readily available grey methanol.\nMeaningful improvement on GHG emissions – up to 27% fewer GHG emissions when operating on readily available grey methanol.\nTowards Zero GHG – an 85% GHG emissions reduction is possible when using 100% green methanol, which is starting to become available in marine quantities. Substantial GHG emissions can still be made by using a blend of grey and green methanol.\n\nRobert Schluter, Co-Founder and Managing Director of e1 Marine\ne1 Marine’s solution provides clear advantages of future-proofing inland waterways, ports, and short sea vessels against current and anticipated increasingly robust GHG and local pollutant regulation. It also enables ocean-going vessel operators an option to utilize the onboard methanol to hydrogen generator technology while in port amid more stringent port emissions rules.\nRobert Schluter, Managing Director, e1 Marine, commented: “As the shipping industry faces a plethora of regulations that will continue to ratchet up in terms of levels of compliance, it is vital to take a holistic approach to plan for next-gen propulsion. For smaller vessel’s main propulsion and ocean-going vessels auxiliary engines, the Thetius findings – based on a large amount of operating data, enabling a reasonable degree of accuracy – underline the capacity of e1 Marine’s methanol to hydrogen generator technology to almost eradicate local pollutant concerns and offer a clear pathway to 2030 and 2050 GHG emission compliance.\n“Renewable alternatives, such as hydrogen, are gaining traction. However, pure hydrogen faces challenges in transportation and storage, hindering its implementation for direct fuel usage. e1 Marine’s technology fosters sustainable and eco-friendly marine operations that negate these challenges.”\nNick Chubb, CEO, Thetius, added: “Our model suggests that the e1 Marine’s methanol to hydrogen generators potentially produce 10-27% fewer GHG emissions than conventional diesel ICEs operating on grey methanol. Moreover, a blend of green and grey methanol can achieve substantial reductions, with 85% GHG emissions reduction possible when using green methanol. Therefore, the initial results are promising and show the clear advantages methanol to hydrogen generator technology can bring.”\nFrom 1 January 2030, a ship (being any containership and any passenger ship (over 5,000 GT) not otherwise exempted under the legislation) moored at berth for two hours or longer in an EU port shall be required to connect to an on-shore power supply (OPS) (or alternative, approved zero-emission technology).\nIn the United States, port emissions are managed by local authorities, with policies that vary from state to state. For example, in 2021, California’s State Office of Administrative Law tightened emissions regulations defined by the Control Measure for Ocean-Going Vessels at Berth, which includes limits on GHGs and adds shore power mandates.\nSource: e1 Marine",

      "articleText": "Maritime’s voyage to decarbonisation is underway, with shipping companies exploring technologies that harness wind, waves and even air bubbles to ensure their ships burn less fuel. Improved vessel design is making ships more efficient and safer for seafarers, and alternative fuels are being explored to help reduce the industry’s impact on climate change. However, there is another option to add to those already in play: navigational data.\nModern mariners now rely on a sophisticated network of sensors, satellite systems and the latest technologies to gather data about their vessel’s journey. Using GPS and radar systems, weather forecasts and real-time voyage data, they can establish a clear picture of the maritime environment. Such information also gives them visibility of the surrounding sea conditions, depths, currents and tides.\nNavigational data supports decarbonisation, enabling seafarers and fleet managers to reduce a vessel’s emissions by optimising its speed, route and operations. Previous generations of mariners with no access to this information would often follow established routes that may be less fuel-efficient, generating more emissions than necessary. But the arrival of data analytics and machine-learning algorithms allow shipping companies to identify the shortest, most optimal routes based on favourable currents, winds, and sea conditions, by comparing historical navigational patterns to real-time data.\nWhen integrated with sophisticated carbon monitoring systems on board, navigational data enables shipping companies to track a vessel’s fuel consumption and emissions in real-time. As such, they can make necessary adjustments to optimise the ship’s performance.\nThe benefits of data are there to be unlocked both at sea and on shore. Accessing near real-time information is a gamechanger for optimising port arrivals. With data sharing between ports and ships, fleet managers and crewmembers can speed up, slow down or update their course to ensure they arrive right on time. A just-in-time arrival enables them to approach a port exactly when they are due, cutting out the need to wait in line for a berth or idling in anchorages, which in turn minimises downtime and emissions.\nSuch precision could have a positive impact on the environment, with the International Maritime Organization estimating that just-in-time arrivals may, in the near term, reduce fuel consumption and emissions by 11%.\nCharlie Fardon\nThe UK Hydrographic Office is contributing to the advancement of just-in-time arrivals through our participation in the Blue Visby Consortium, which aims to bring to market the Blue Visby Solution (BVS). The BVS introduces a queuing system for ships bound to the same destination port. The system will synchronise and optimise the ocean passages of a group of vessels, allocating optimised arrival times, and ensuring an arrival frequency at which the port can handle.\nAs well as unlocking just-in-time arrivals, navigational data is also key to helping establish green shipping corridors. These corridors, which are marked by optimised routes and sustainable practices, offer a blueprint for reducing the carbon footprint of maritime transportation. They involve public and private stakeholders carrying out actions and initiatives, related to port and ship technology, fuel usage, and voyage optimisation. Green corridors can operate domestically, short-sea or across continents and multiple ports.\nNavigational data plays such a pivotal role because of its ability to clearly and accurately represent the marine environment that ships must travel through. This information is invaluable for planning, monitoring and optimising activity within a green shipping corridor – and may even be able to be used to underpin investments in fuel and other marine infrastructure.\nThe shipping industry’s ongoing journey towards a greener future relies on navigational data that will reshape how vessels navigate the world’s oceans. By harnessing the full power of such information, the sector can achieve its decarbonisation goals and support other industries working to tackle climate change.\nSource: By Charlie Fardon, Head of Sustainability, UK Hydrographic Office",

Moller – Maersk (Maersk) and Amazon have finalized a 2023-2024 agreement for the transport of 20,000 FFE containers using green biofuel through Maersk’s “ECO Delivery” ocean product offering. Maersk estimates this purchase will contribute to a reduction in 44,600 metric tons of CO2e vs standard bunker fuel, roughly equivalent to 50 million pounds of coal burned. This is the fourth consecutive year that Amazon and Maersk have arranged container shipping using low GHG fuel options.\n“We’re proud to collaborate with Maersk, a Climate Pledge signatory and leader in shipping logistics, on actionable solutions to decarbonize maritime shipping,” said Adam Baker, Vice President of Global Transportation at Amazon. “We’re excited to have containers on Maersk’s first methanol-enabled feeder vessel and to continue using their biofuel.”\nThe ECO Delivery biofuel option offers emission reductions that enable immediate and externally verified GHG savings for customers, without compensatory measures like offsetting. This year, Amazon will benefit from a new feature of the ECO Delivery product which will be enabled by also using green methanol in addition to the bio diesel as a second green fuel* in the vessel fleet. ECO Delivery is using primary data for fuel consumption in the methodology to report emissions savings with greater precision, inclusive of other greenhouse gases in addition to the CO2. The new model also provides price certainty and stability and is de-linked from the fossil fuel market.\n“Amazon’s record of securing sustainable shipping over the years, no matter the business climate, is testament to its contributions to building a better future. We share a common goal with Amazon to reduce our total GHG emissions to net zero by 2040. As cosigners of the Climate Pledge, we must constantly create new opportunities to make this a decade of action. Decarbonizing shipping is one significant step that is to be combined with many others to protect our future,” said Narin Phol, President North America, A.P. Moller – Maersk.\nCo-founded by Global Optimism and Amazon, the Climate Pledge is powered by over 400 companies in 38 countries around the globe. The pledge is a commitment to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. Signatories agree to 1.) Measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis, 2.) Implement decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement, and 3.) Neutralize any remaining emissions with credible offsets. To learn more about the Amazon and Maersk’s commitment to the future, visit the “Sustainability at A.P. Moller – Maersk” and “Sustainability at Amazon” web pages.\n* Maersk defines ’green fuels’ as fuels with low to very low GHG emissions over their life cycle compared to fossil fuels. Maersk green fuels and its supply chain are verified by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) . The methodology for accounting emissions is based on GLEC (Global Logistics Emissions Council) and is certified by Smart Freight Center. We ensure auto-generated performance tracking of Maersk ECO Delivery shipments. Maersk ECO Delivery CO2e saving certificates will be issued. The method is audited by PwC in accordance with the International Standard of Assurance Engagements 3410 (ISAE 3410 – Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements), showing CO₂e savings for the scope of the Maersk ECO Delivery agreement.\nSource: A.P.

(FUKUI) and ClassNK have signed a Memorandum of Understanding concerning a joint study on a safety relief valve for a cargo tank of liquefied hydrogen carriers at the “Gastech2023” held in Singapore.\nTo combat global warming, attention is growing towards hydrogen as an energy source that does not emit CO2 at the point of use. The realization of a hydrogen-based society necessitates the establishment of a secure and efficient supply chain that distributes hydrogen produced in an environmentally friendly manner to consumption areas. As the measure to transport large volumes of hydrogen over long distances efficiently, carrying liquefied hydrogen via ships are considered promising, spurring ongoing advancements in related technologies.\nIn order to ensure safety in the transport of liquefied hydrogen, the development of safety relief valves that can handle hydrogen’s characteristics including extremely low temperatures, ease of leakage, and hydrogen embrittlement, which leads to a decrease in material strength and toughness, is necessary. Appropriate safety standards are also required. As part of the efforts to establish key technologies for hydrogen transport, FUKUI and ClassNK have agreed to jointly conduct a study for the installation of safety relief valves for cargo tanks of liquefied hydrogen carriers on actual ships.\nRight: Mr. Yo Fukui, President and CEO, FUKUI Left: Mr. Hayato Suga, Executive Vice President, ClassNK\nYo Fukui, President and CEO, FUKUI said, “FUKUI aims to be a leading company in ensuring the safety of customers’ equipment for realization of a decarbonized society worldwide. For the hydrogen supply chain, it is crucial to have the commitment and the ability to execute to overcome various challenges such as extremely low temperatures and hydrogen embrittlement. I’m convinced that the MOU signed today with ClassNK will be a significant step towards achieving a sustainable society.”\nHayato Suga, Executive Vice President, ClassNK said, “ClassNK is pleased to launch a new partnership with FUKUI, dedicated to decarbonizing society. Through our extensive experience with liquefied hydrogen carriers, we will apply our expertise to advance the development and standard relevant to the technology, thereby supporting the global adoption of liquified hydrogen carriers.”\nSource: ClassNK",
